    <h3>THE LIGHTHOUSE BUILDERS</h3>

    <p class="poem">". . . For the sake
    <br>
     Of these, my kinsmen and my countrymen,
    <br>
     Who early and late in the windy ocean toiled
    <br>
     To plant a star for seamen."</p>
    <br>


    <p>The pirate, Ralph the Rover, so legend tells, while cruising
    off the coast of Scotland searching for booty or sport, sank
    the warning bell on one of the great rocks, to plague the good
    Abbot of Arbroath who had put it there. The following year the
    Rover returned and perished himself on the same rock.</p>

    <p>In the life of one of Scotland's great men, Robert Louis
    Stevenson, we find proud record of his grandfather, Robert
    Stevenson, having built Bell Rock Lighthouse on this same spot
    years afterward.</p>

    <p>No story of Robert Louis Stevenson's life would be complete
    that failed to mention the work done for Scotland and the world
    at large by the two men he held most dear, the engineers, his
    father and grandfather.</p>

    <p>When Robert Stevenson, his grandfather, received his
    appointment on the Board of Northern Lights the art of
    lighthouse building in Scotland had just begun. Its bleak,
    rocky shores were world-famous for their danger, and few
    mariners cared to venture around them. At that time the coast
    "was lighted at a single point, the Isle of May, in the jaws of
    the Firth of Forth, where, on a tower already a hundred and
    fifty years old, an open coal-fire blazed in an open chaufer.
    The whole archipelago thus nightly plunged in darkness was
    shunned by seagoing vessels." <a name="FNanchor__1"
       id="FNanchor__1"></a><a href="#Footnote__1"
       class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

    <p>The board at first proposed building four new lights, but
    afterward built many more, so that to-day Scotland stands
    foremost among the nations for the number and splendor of her
    coast lights.</p>

    <p>Their construction in those early days meant working against
    tremendous obstacles and dangers, and the life of the engineer
    was a hazardous one.</p>

    <p>"The seas into which his labors carried him were still
    scarce charted, the coasts still dark; his way on shore was
    often far beyond the convenience of any road; the isles in
    which he must sojourn were still partly savage. He must toss
    much in boats; he must often adventure much on horseback by
    dubious bridle-track through unfrequented wildernesses; he must
    sometimes plant his lighthouses in the very camp of
    wreckers.</p>

    <p>"The aid of steam was not yet. At first in random coasting
    sloop, and afterwards in the cutter belonging to the service,
    the engineer must ply and run amongst these multiplied dangers
    and sometimes late into the stormy autumn."</p>

    <p>All of which failed to daunt Robert Stevenson who loved
    action and adventure and the scent of things romantic.</p>

    <p>"Not only had towers to be built and apparatus transplanted,
    the supply of oil must be maintained and the men fed, in the
    same inaccessible and distant scenes, a whole service with its
    routine ... had to be called out of nothing; and a new trade
    (that of light-keeper) to be taught, recruited and
    organized."</p>

    <p>Bell Rock was only one of twenty lighthouses Robert
    Stevenson helped to build, but it was by far the most difficult
    one ... and even to-day, after it has been lighted for more
    than a hundred years, it still remains unique&mdash;a monument
    to his skill.</p>

    <p>Bell Rock was practically a reef completely submerged at
    full tide and only a few feet of its crest visible at low
    water. To raise a tower on it meant placing a foundation under
    water, a new and perilous experiment.</p>

    <p>"Work upon the rock in the earliest stages was confined to
    the calmest days of the summer season, when the tides were
    lowest, the water smoothest, and the wind in its calmest mood.
    Under such conditions the men were able to stay on the site for
    about five hours....</p>

    <p>"One distinct drawback was the necessity to establish a
    depot some distance from the erecting site. Those were the days
    before steam navigation, and the capricious sailing craft
    offered the only means of maintaining communication between
    rock and shore, and for the conveyance of men and materials to
    and fro....</p>

    <p>"A temporary beacon was placed on the reef, while adjacent
    to the site selected for the tower a smith's forge was made
    fast, so as to withstand the dragging motion of the waves when
    the rock was submerged. The men were housed on the
    <i>Smeaton</i>, which, during the spells of work on the rock,
    rode at anchor a short distance away in deep water."
       <a name="FNanchor__2"
       id="FNanchor__2"></a><a href="#Footnote__2"
       class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

    <p>Once the engineers were all but lost when the <i>Smeaton</i>
    slipped her moorings and left them stranded on the rock.</p>

    <p>In spite of all the obstacles, the work was completed at the
    end of two years and the light was shown for the first time
    February 1, 1811.</p>

    <p>"I found Robert Stevenson an appreciative and intelligent
    companion," writes Sir Walter Scott in his journal, speaking of
    a cruise he made among the islands of Scotland with a party of
    engineers. The notes made by him on this trip were used
    afterward in his two stories, "The Pirate" and "Lord of the
    Isles."</p>

    <p>"My grandfather was king in the service to his finger-tips,"
    wrote Louis Stevenson. "All should go his way, from the
    principal light-keeper's coat to the assistant's fender, from
    the gravel in the garden walks to the bad smell in the kitchen,
    or the oil spots on the storeroom floor. It might be thought
    there was nothing more calculated to awaken men's resentment,
    and yet his rule was not more thorough than it was beneficent.
    His thought for the keepers was continual.... When a keeper was
    sick, he lent him his horse and sent him mutton and brandy from
    the ship.... They dwelt, many of them, in uninhabited isles or
    desert forelands, totally cut off from shops.</p>

    <p>"No servant of the Northern Lights came to Edinburgh but he
    was entertained at Baxter Place. There at his own table my
    grandfather sat down delightedly with his broad-spoken,
    homespun officers."</p>

    <p>As he grew old his "medicine and delight" was his annual
    trip among his lighthouses, but at length there came a time
    when this joy was taken away from him and there came "the end
    of all his cruising; the knowledge that he had looked the last
    on Sunburgh, and the wild crags of Skye, and the Sound of Mull;
    that he was never again to hear the surf break in Clashcarnock;
    never again to see lighthouse after lighthouse (all younger
    than himself, and the more, part of his own device) open in the
    hour of dusk their flower of fire, or the topaz and ruby
    interchange on the summit of Bell Rock."</p>

    <p>Throughout the rank and file of his men he was adored. "I
    have spoken with many who knew him; I was his grandson, and
    their words may very well have been words of flattery; but
    there was one thing that could not be affected, and that was
    the look that came over their faces at the name of Robert
    Stevenson."</p>

    <p>Of his family of thirteen children, three of his sons became
    engineers. Thomas Stevenson, the father of Robert Louis, like
    the others of his family, contributed largely to lighthouse
    building and harbor improvement, serving under his older
    brother, Allen, in building the Skerryvore, one of the most
    famous deep-sea lights erected on a treacherous reef off the
    west coast where, for more than forty years, one wreck after
    another had occurred.</p>

    <p>"From the navigator's point of view, the danger of this spot
    lay chiefly in the fact that it was so widely scattered. The
    ridge runs like a broken backbone for a distance of some eight
    miles.... In rough weather the whole of the rocks are covered,
    and the waves, beating heavily on the mass, convert the scene
    into one of indescribable tumult....</p>

    <p>"There was only one point where a tower could be placed, and
    this was so exposed that the safe handling of men and material
    constituted a grave responsibility."</p>

    <p>It was necessary to erect a tower one hundred and thirty
    feet high; "the loftiest and weightiest work of its character
    that had ever been contemplated up to this time....</p>

    <p>"The Atlantic swell, which rendered landing on the ridge
    precarious and hazardous, did not permit the men to be housed
    upon a floating home, as had been the practice in the early
    days of the Bell Rock tower. In order to permit the work to go
    forward as uninterruptedly as the sea would allow, a peculiar
    barrack was erected. It was a house on stilts, the legs being
    sunk firmly into the rock, with the living quarters perched
    some fifty feet up in the air.</p>

    <p>"Residence in this tower was eerie. The men climbed the
    ladder and entered a small room, which served the purposes of
    kitchen, living-room, and parlor....</p>

    <p>"When a storm was raging, the waves, as they combed over the
    rock, shook the legs violently and scurried under the floor in
    seething foam. Now and again a roller, rising higher than its
    fellows, broke upon the rock and sent a mass of water against
    the flooring to hammer at the door. Above the living-room were
    the sleeping quarters, high and dry, save when a shower of
    spray fell upon the roof and walls like heavy hail.... The men,
    however, were not perturbed. Sleeping, even under such
    conditions, was far preferable to doubtful rest in a bunk upon
    an attendant vessel, rolling and pitching with the motion of
    the sea. They had had a surfeit of such experience ... while
    the barrack was under erection.</p>

    <p>"For two years it withstood the seas without incident, and
    the engineer and men came to regard the eyrie as safe as a
    house on shore. But one night the little colony received a
    shock. The angry Atlantic got one or two of its trip-hammer
    blows well home, and smashed the structure to fragments.
    Fortunately, at the time it was untenanted."</p>

    <p>No time was lost in rebuilding the barrack and this time it
    withstood all tests until it was torn down after Skerryvore was
    finished.</p>

    <p>"While the foundations were being prepared, and until the
    barrack was constructed, the men ran other terrible risks every
    morning and night landing upon and leaving the polished surface
    of the reef. Five months during the summer was the working
    season, but even then many days and weeks were often lost owing
    to the swell being too great to permit the rowing boat to come
    alongside. The engineer relates that the work was 'a good
    lesson in the school of patience,' because the delays were
    frequent and galling, while every storm which got up and
    expended its rage upon the reef left its mark indelibly among
    the engineer's stock in trade. Cranes and other materials were
    swept away as if they were corks; lashings, no matter how
    strong, were snapped like pack-threads.</p>

    <p>"Probably the worst experience was when the men on the rock
    were weather-bound for seven weeks during one season.... Their
    provisions sank to a very low level, they ran short of fuel,
    their sodden clothing was worn to rags....</p>

    <p>"Six years were occupied in the completion of the work, and,
    as may be imagined, the final touches were welcomed with
    thankfulness by those who had been concerned in the
    enterprise."</p>

    <p>It was in meteorological researches and illumination of
    lighthouses, however, that Thomas Stevenson did his greatest
    work. It was he who brought to perfection the revolving light
    now so generally used.</p>

    <p>In spite of this and other valuable inventions his name has
    remained little known, owing to the fact that none of his
    inventions were ever patented. The Stevensons believed that,
    holding government appointments, any original work they did
    belonged to the nation. "A patent not only brings in money but
    spreads reputation," writes his son, "and my father's
    instruments enter anonymously into a hundred light rooms and
    are passed anonymously over in a hundred reports, where the
    least considerable patent would stand out and tell its author's
    story."</p>

    <p>He was beloved among a wide circle of friends and the esteem
    of those in his profession was shown when in 1884 they chose
    him for president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. To the
    general public, however, he remained unknown in spite of the
    fact that "His lights were in all parts of the world guiding
    the mariners."</p>

    <h3>ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON</h3>

    <p class="poem">"As from the house your mother sees
    <br>
     You playing round the garden trees,
    <br>
     So you may see, if you will look
    <br>
     Through the window of this book,

     Another child, far, far away,
    <br>
     And in another garden, play."</p>

    <p class="poem"><span style=
    "text-align: center;">&mdash;"Child's Garden of
    Verses."</span></p>
    <br>


    <p>Robert Louis Balfour Stevenson was born at No. 8 Howard
    Place, Edinburgh, Scotland, November 13, 1850.</p>

    <p>In 1852 the family moved from Howard Place to Inverleith
    Terrace, and two years later to No. 17 Heriot Row, which
    remained their home for many years.</p>

    <p>As a child Louis was very delicate and often ill, for years
    hardly a winter passed that he did not spend many days in
    bed.</p>

    <p>Edinburgh in winter is extremely damp and he tells us: "Many
    winters I never crossed the threshold, but used to lie on my
    face on the nursery floor, chalking or painting in water-colors
    the pictures in the illustrated newspapers; or sit up in bed
    with a little shawl pinned about my shoulders, to play with
    bricks or what not."</p>

    <p>The diverting history of "Hop-O'-My-Thumb" and the
    "Seven-League Boots," "Little Arthur's History of England,"
    "Peter Parley's Historical Tales," and "Harry's Ladder to
    Learning" were books which he delighted to pore over and their
    pages bore many traces of his skill with the pencil and
    paint-brush.</p>

    <p>Those who have read the "Child's Garden of Verses" already
    know the doings of his childish days, for although those rhymes
    were not written until he was a grown man he was "one of the
    few who do not forget their own lives" and "through the windows
    of this book" gives us a vivid and living picture of the boy
    who dwelt so much in a world of his own with his quaint
    thoughts.</p>

    <p>If his body was frail his spirit was strong and his power of
    imagination so great that he cheered himself through many a
    weary day by playing he was "captain of a tidy little ship," a
    soldier, a fierce pirate, an Indian chief, or an explorer in
    foreign lands. Miles he travelled in his little bed.</p>

    <p class="poem">"I have just to shut my eyes,
    <br>
     To go sailing through the skies&mdash;
    <br>
     To go sailing far away
    <br>
     To the pleasant Land of Play"</p>

    <p>In spite of his power for amusing himself, days like these
    would have gone far harder had it not been for two devoted
    people, his mother and his nurse, Alison Cunningham or "Cummie"
    as he called her. His mother was devoted to him in every way
    and encouraged his love for reading and story-making. She kept
    a diary of his progress from day to day, and treasured every
    picture he drew or scrap he wrote. Cummie came to him as a
    Torryburn lassie when he was eighteen months old and was like a
    second mother to him. She not only cared for his bodily
    comforts but was his friend and comrade as well. She sang for
    him, danced for him, spun fine tales of pirates and smugglers,
    and read to him so dramatically that his mind was fired then
    and there with a longing for travel and adventure which he
    never lost. When they took their walks through the streets
    together Cummie had many stories to tell him of Scotland and
    Edinburgh in the old days. For Edinburgh is a wonderful old
    city with a wonderful history full of tales of stirring
    adventure and romance. "For centuries it was a capitol thatched
    with heather and more than once, in the evil days of English
    invasion, it has gone up in flames to Heaven, a beacon to ships
    at sea.... It was the jousting-ground of jealous nobles, not
    only on Greenside or by the King's Stables, where set
    tournaments were fought to the sound of trumpets and under the
    authority of the royal presence, but in every alley where there
    was room to cross swords.... In the town, in one of those
    little shops plastered like so many swallows' nests among the
    buttresses of the old Cathedral, that familiar autocrat James
    VI. would gladly share a bottle of wine with George Heriot the
    goldsmith. Up on the Pentland Hills, that so quietly look down
    on the castle with the city lying in waves around it, those mad
    and dismal fanatics, the Sweet Singers, haggard from long
    exposure on the moors, sat day and night 'with tearful
    psalms.'... In the Grassmarket, stiff-necked covenanting heroes
    offered up the often unnecessary, but not less honorable,
    sacrifice of their lives, and bade eloquent farewell to sun,
    moon and stars and earthly friendships, or died silent to the
    roll of the drums. Down by yon outlet rode Grahame of
    Claverhouse and his thirty dragoons, with the town beating to
    arms behind their horses' tails&mdash;a sorry handful thus
    riding for their lives, but with a man at their head who was to
    return in a different temper, make a bold dash that staggered
    Scotland, and die happily in the thick of the fight....</p>

    <p>"The palace of Holyrood is a house of many memories....
    Great people of yore, kings and queens, buffoons and grave
    ambassadors played their stately farce for centuries in
    Holyrood. Wars have been plotted, dancing has lasted deep into
    the night, murder has been done in its chambers. There Prince
    Charlie held his phantom levées and in a very gallant manner
    represented a fallen dynasty for some hours....</p>

    <p>"There is an old story of the subterranean passage between
    the castle and Holyrood and a bold Highland piper who
    volunteered to explore its windings. He made his entrance by
    the upper end, playing a strathspey; the curious footed it
    after him down the street, following his descent by the sound
    of the chanter from below; until all of a sudden, about the
    level of St. Giles the music came abruptly to an end, and the
    people in the street stood at fault with hands uplifted.
    Whether he choked with gases, or perished in a quag, or was
    removed bodily by the Evil One, remains a point of doubt, but
    the piper has never again been seen or heard of from that day
    to this. Perhaps he wandered down into the land of Thomas the
    Rhymer, and some day, when it is least expected, may take a
    thought to revisit the sunlit upper world. That will be a
    strange moment for the cabmen on the stands beside St. Giles,
    when they hear the crone of his pipes reascending from the
    earth below their horses' feet."</p>

    <p>In Edinburgh to-day there are armed men and cannon in the
    castle high up on the great rock above you: "You may see the
    troops marshalled on the high parade, and at night after the
    early winter evenfall and in the morning before the laggard
    winter dawn, the wind carries abroad over Edinburgh the sounds
    of drums and bugles." <a name="FNanchor__3"
       id="FNanchor__3"></a><a href="#Footnote__3"
       class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

    <p>Long before Louis could write he made up verses and stories
    for himself, and Cummie wrote them down for him. "I thought
    they were rare nonsense then," she said, little dreaming that
    these same bits of "rare nonsense" were the beginnings of what
    was to make "her boy" famous across two seas in years to
    come.</p>

    <p>He writes of her when speaking of long nights he lay awake
    unable to sleep because of a troublesome cough: "How well I
    remember her lifting me out of bed, carrying me to the window
    and showing me one or two lit windows up in Queen Street across
    the dark belt of garden, where also, we told each other, there
    might be sick little boys and their nurses waiting, like us,
    for the morning."</p>

    <p>Her devotion to him had its reward in the love he gave her
    all his life. One of his early essays written when he was
    twenty and published in the <i>Juvenilia</i> was called
    "Nurses." Fifteen years later came the publication of the
    "Child's Garden of Verses" with a splendid tribute to her as a
    dedication. He sent her copies of all his books, wrote letters
    to her, and invited her to visit him. She herself tells that
    the last time she ever saw him he said to her, "before a room
    full of people, 'It's <i>you</i> that gave me a passion for the
    drama, Cummie,' 'Me, Master Lou,' I said, 'I never put foot
    inside a playhouse in my life.' 'Ay, woman,' said he, 'but it
    was the good dramatic way ye had of reciting the hymns.'"</p>

    <p>When he was six years old his Uncle David offered a Bible
    picture-book as a prize to the nephews who could write the best
    history of Moses.</p>

    <p>This was Louis's first real literary attempt. He was not
    able to write himself, but dictated to his mother and
    illustrated the story and its cover with pictures which he
    designed and painted himself.</p>

    <p>He won the prize and from that time, his mother says, "it
    was the desire of his heart to be an author."</p>

    <p>During the winter of 1856-57 his favorite cousin, Robert
    Alan Mowbray Stevenson, usually called Bob, visited them; a
    great treat for Louis, not only because his ill health kept him
    from making many companions of his own age, but because Bob
    loved many of the same things he did and to "make believe" was
    as much a part of his life as Louis's. Many fine games they had
    together; built toy theatres, the scenery and characters for
    which they bought for a "penny plain and twopence colored," and
    were never tired of dressing up. One of their chief delights,
    he says, was in "rival kingdoms of our own
    invention&mdash;Nosingtonia and Encyclopædia, of which we were
    perpetually drawing maps." Even the eating of porridge at
    breakfast became a game. Bob ate his with sugar and said it was
    an island covered with snow with here a mountain and there a
    valley; while Louis's was an island flooded by milk which
    gradually disappeared bit by bit.</p>

    <p>In the spring and summer his mother took him for short trips
    to the watering-places near Edinburgh. But the spot unlike all
    others for a real visit was at Colinton Manse, the home of his
    grandfather, the Reverend Lewis Balfour, at Colinton, on the
    Water of Leith, five miles southwest of Edinburgh. Here he
    spent glorious days. Not only was there the house and garden,
    both rare spots for one of an exploring turn of mind, but, best
    of all, there were the numerous cousins of his own age sent out
    from India, where their parents were, to be nursed and educated
    under the loving eye of Aunt Jane Balfour, for whom he
    wrote:</p>

    <p class="poem">"Chief of our aunts&mdash;not only I,
    <br>
     But all the dozen nurslings cry&mdash;
    <br>
     What did the other children do?
    <br>
     And what was childhood, wanting you?"</p>

    <p>If Louis lacked brothers and sisters he had no dearth of
    cousins, fifty in all they numbered, many of them near his own
    age. Alan Stevenson, Henrietta and Willie Traquair seem to have
    been his favorite chums at Colinton.</p>

    <p>Of his grandfather Balfour he says: "We children admired
    him, partly for his beautiful face and silver hair ... partly
    for the solemn light in which we beheld him once a week, the
    observed of all observers in the pulpit. But his strictness and
    distance, the effect, I now fancy, of old age, slow blood, and
    settled habits, oppressed us with a kind of terror. When not
    abroad, he sat much alone writing sermons or letters to his
    scattered family.... The study had a redeeming grace in many
    Indian pictures gaudily colored and dear to young eyes.... When
    I was once sent in to say a psalm to my grandfather, I went,
    quaking indeed with fear, but at the same time glowing with
    hope that, if I said it well, he might reward me with an Indian
    picture."</p>

    <p>"There were two ways of entering the Manse garden," he says,
    "one the two-winged gate that admitted the old phaeton and the
    other a door for pedestrians on the side next the kirk.... On
    the left hand were the stables, coach-houses and washing
    houses, clustered around a small, paved court.... Once past the
    stable you were fairly within the garden. On summer afternoons
    the sloping lawn was literally <i>steeped</i> in
    sunshine....</p>

    <p>"The wall of the church faces the manse, but the church yard
    is on a level with the top of the wall ... and the tombstones
    are visible from the enclosure of the manse.... Under the
    retaining wall was a somewhat dark pathway, extending from the
    stable to the far end of the garden, and called the 'witches'
    walk' from a game we used to play in it.... Even out of the
    'witches' walk' you saw the Manse facing toward you, with its
    back to the river and the wooded bank, and the bright
    flower-plots and stretches of comfortable vegetables in front
    and on each side of it; flower plots and vegetable borders, by
    the way, on which it was almost death to set foot, and about
    which we held a curious belief,&mdash;namely, that my
    grandfather went round and measured any footprints that he saw,
    to compare the measurement at night with the boots put out for
    brushing; to avoid which we were accustomed, by a strategic
    movement of the foot to make the mark longer....</p>

    <p>"So much for the garden; now follow me into the house. On
    entering the door you had before you a stone paved lobby....
    There stood a case of foreign birds, two or three marble
    deities from India and a lily of the Nile in a pot, and at the
    far end the stairs shut in the view. With how many games of
    'tig' or brick-building in the forenoon is the long low dining
    room connected in my mind! The storeroom was a most voluptuous
    place, with its piles of biscuit boxes and spice tins, the rack
    for buttered eggs, the little window that let in the sunshine
    and the flickering shadows of leaves, and the strong sweet odor
    of everything that pleaseth the taste of men....</p>

    <p>"Opposite the study was the parlor, a small room crammed
    full of furniture and covered with portraits, with a cabinet at
    the side full of foreign curiosities, and a sort of anatomical
    trophy on the top. During a grand cleaning of the apartment I
    remember all the furniture was ranged on a circular grass plot
    between the churchyard and the house. It was a lovely still
    summer evening, and I stayed out, climbing among the chairs and
    sofas. Falling on a large bone or skull, I asked what it was.
    Part of an albatross, auntie told me. 'What is an albatross?' I
    asked, and then she described to me this great bird nearly as
    big as a house, that you saw out miles away from any land,
    sleeping above the vast and desolate ocean. She told me that
    the <i>Ancient Mariner</i> was all about one; and quoted with
    great <i>verve</i> (she had a duster in her hand, I
    recollect)&mdash;</p>

    <p class="poem">'With my crossbow
    <br>
     I shot the albatross.'</p>

    <p>... Willie had a crossbow, but up to this date I had never
    envied him its possession. After this, however, it became one
    of the objects of my life."</p>

    <p>With many playmates, free to roam and romp as he chose, his
    illness forgotten, it is no wonder he says he felt as if he led
    two lives, one belonging to Edinburgh and one to the country,
    and that Colinton ever remained an enchanted spot to which it
    was always hard to say good-by.</p>

    <p>School days began for Louis in 1859, but were continually
    interrupted by illness, travel, and change of school. His
    father did not believe in forcing him to study; so he roamed
    through school according to his own sweet will, attending
    classes where he cared to, interesting himself in the subjects
    that appealed to him&mdash;Latin, French, and
    mathematics&mdash;neglecting the others and bringing home no
    prizes, to Cummie's distress.</p>

    <p>Certain books were his prime favorites at this time.
    "Robinson Crusoe," he says, "and some of the books of Mayne
    Reid and a book called Paul Blake&mdash;Swiss Family Robinson
    also. At these I played, conjured up their scenes and delighted
    to hear them rehearsed to seventy times seven.</p>

    <p>"My father's library was a spot of some austerity; the
    proceedings of learned societies, cyclopædias, physical science
    and above all, optics held the chief place upon the shelves,
    and it was only in holes and corners that anything legible
    existed as if by accident. Parents' Assistant, Rob Roy,
    Waverley and Guy Mannering, Pilgrim's Progress, Voyages of
    Capt. Woods Rogers, Ainsworth's Tower of London and four old
    volumes of Punch&mdash;these were among the chief
    exceptions.</p>

    <p>"In these latter which made for years the chief of my diet,
    I very early fell in love (almost as soon as I could spell)
    with the Snob Papers. I knew them almost by heart ... and I
    remember my surprise when I found long afterward that they were
    famous, and signed with a famous name; to me, as I read and
    admired them, they were the works of Mr. Punch."</p>

    <p>Two old Bibles interested him particularly. They had
    belonged to his grandfather Stevenson and contained many marked
    passages and notes telling how they had been read aboard
    lighthouse tenders and on tours of inspection among the
    islands.</p>

    <p>After he was thirteen his health was greatly improved and he
    was able to enjoy the comradeship of other lads, though he
    never cared greatly for sports. He was the leader of a number
    of boys who used to go about playing tricks on the
    neighbors&mdash;"tapping on their windows after nightfall, and
    all manner of wild freaks."</p>

    <p>"Crusoing" was a favorite game and its name stood for all
    picnicking in the open air, building bonfires and cooking
    apples, but the crowning sport of all was "Lantern Bearing," a
    game invented by himself and shared by a dozen of his
    cronies.</p>

    <p>"Toward the end of September," he says, "when school time
    was drawing near and the nights were already black, we would
    begin to sally from our respective villas, each equipped with a
    tin bull's-eye lantern.... We wore them buckled to the waist
    upon a cricket belt, and over them, such was the rigor of the
    game, a buttoned top-coat. They smelled noxiously of blistered
    tin; they never burned aright, though they would always burn
    our fingers; their use was naught; the pleasure of them merely
    fanciful; and yet a boy with a bull's-eye under his top-coat
    asked for nothing more.</p>

    <p>"When two of these asses met there would be an anxious,
    'Have you your lantern?' and a gratified 'Yes,' That was the
    shibboleth, and a very needful one too; for as it was the rule
    to keep our glory contained, none could recognize a
    lantern-bearer, unless like a polecat, by the smell.</p>

    <p>"The essence of this bliss was to walk by yourself in the
    black night, the slide shut, the top-coat buttoned, not a ray
    escaping whether to conduct your footsteps or make your glory
    public, a mere pillar of darkness in the dark, and all the
    while, deep down in the privacy of your fool's heart, to know
    you had a bull's-eye at your belt and exult and sing over the
    knowledge."</p>

    <p>In later years one of the Lantern Bearers describes Louis as
    he was then. "A slender, long legged boy in pepper and salt
    tweeds, with an undescribable influence that forced us to
    include him in our play as a looker on, critic and slave
    driver.... No one had the remotest intention of competing with
    R.L.S. in story making, and his tales, had we known it, were
    such as the world would listen to in silence and wonder."</p>

    <p>At home and at his last school he was always starting
    magazines. The stories were illustrated with much color and the
    magazines circulated among the boys for a penny a reading. One
    was called <i>The Sunbeam Magazine</i>, an illustrated
    miscellany of fact, fiction, and fun, and another <i>The School
    Boy Magazine</i>. The latter contained four stories and its
    readers must have been hard to satisfy if they did not have
    their fill of horrors&mdash;"regular crawlers," Louis called
    them. In the first tale, "The Adventures of Jan Van Steen," the
    hero is left hidden in a boiler under which a fire is lit. The
    second is a "Ghost Story" of robbers in a deserted castle....
    The third is called, "by curious anticipation of a story he was
    to write later on, 'The Wreckers.'"</p>

    <p>Numerous plays and novels he began but they eventually found
    their fate in the trash basket. An exception to this was a
    small green pamphlet of twenty pages called "The Pentland
    Rising, a page of history, 1666." It was published through his
    father's interest on the two-hundredth anniversary of the fight
    at Rullion Green. This event in Scotland's history had been
    impressed on his mind by the numerous stories. Cummie had told
    him of the Covenanters and the fact that they had spent the
    night before their defeat in the town of Colinton.</p>

    <p>From the time he was a little chap, balancing on the limb of
    an apple-tree in the Colinton garden trying to see what kind of
    a world lay beyond the garden wall, Louis had had a longing to
    travel and see sights. This began to find satisfaction now.</p>

    <p>His father took him on a trip around the coast of Fife,
    visiting the harbor lights. The little towns along the coast
    were already familiar to him by the stories of the past.
    Dunfermline, where, according to the ballad, Scotland's king
    once "sat in his tower drinking blood-red wine"; Kerkcaldy,
    where the witches used to sink "tall ships and honest mariners
    in the North Sea"; and "Wemyss with its bat-haunted caves,
    where the Chevalier Johnstone on his flight from Colloden
    passed a night of superstitious terrors."</p>

    <p>Later the family made a trip to the English Lakes and in the
    winter of the same year to the south of France, where they
    stayed two months, then making a tour through Italy and
    Switzerland. The following Christmas found Louis and his mother
    again in Mentone, where they stayed until spring.</p>

    <p>French was one of his favorite studies at school, and now
    after a few months among French people he was able to speak
    fluently. Indeed, in after life he was often mistaken for a
    Frenchman.</p>

    <p>His French teacher on his second visit to Mentone gave him
    no regular lessons, but "merely talked to him in French,
    teaching him piquet and card tricks, introducing him to various
    French people and taking him to concerts and other places; so,
    his mother remarks, like Louis' other teachers at home I think
    they found it pleasanter to talk to him then to teach him."</p>

    <p>After their return to Edinburgh came the time when, his
    school days finished, Louis must make up his mind what his
    career is to be and train himself for it.</p>

    <p>Even then he knew what he wanted to do was to write. He had
    fitted up a room on the top floor at Heriot Row as a study and
    spent hours there covering paper with stories or trying to
    describe in the very best way scenes which had impressed him.
    Most of these were discarded when finished. "I liked doing them
    indeed," he said, "but when done I could see they were
    rubbish." He never doubted, however, that some day his attempts
    would prove worth while, if he could only devote his time to
    learning to write and write well.</p>

    <p>His father, he knew, had different plans for him, however.
    Of course, Louis would follow in his footsteps and be the sixth
    Stevenson to hold a place on the Board of Northern Lights. So,
    although he had little heart in the work, he entered the
    University of Edinburgh and spent the next three and a half
    years studying for a science degree.</p>

    <p>The summer of 1868 he was sent with an engineering party to
    Anstruther, on the coast, where a breakwater was being built.
    There he had his first opportunity of seeing some of the
    practical side of engineering. It was rough work, but he
    enjoyed it. Later he spent three weeks on Earraid Island, off
    Mull, a place which left a strong impression on his mind and
    figured afterward as the spot where David Balfour was
    shipwrecked.</p>

    <p>Among the experiences at that time which pleased him most
    was a chance to descend in a diver's dress to the foundation of
    the harbor they were building. In his essays, "Random
    Memories," he tells of the "dizzy muddleheaded joy" he had in
    his surroundings, swaying like a reed, and grabbing at the fish
    which darted past him.</p>

    <p>In writing afterward of these years he says: "What I gleaned
    I am sure I do not know, but indeed I had already my own
    private determination to be an author ... though I haunted the
    breakwater by day, and even loved the place for the sake of the
    sunshine, the thrilling sea-side air, the wash of the waves on
    the sea face, the green glimmer of the diver's helmets far
    below.... My own genuine occupation lay elsewhere and my only
    industry was in the hours when I was not on duty. I lodged with
    a certain Bailie Brown, a carpenter by trade, and there as soon
    as dinner was despatched ... drew my chair to the table and
    proceeded to pour forth literature.</p>

    <p>"I wish to speak with sympathy of my education as an
    engineer. It takes a man into the open air; keeps him hanging
    about harbor sides, the richest form of idling; it carries him
    to wild islands; it gives him a taste of the genial danger of
    the sea ... and when it has done so it carries him back and
    shuts him in an office. From the roaring skerry and the wet
    thwart of the tossing boat, he passes to the stool and desk,
    and with a memory full of ships and seas and perilous headlands
    and shining pharos, he must apply his long-sighted eyes to the
    pretty niceties of drawing or measure his inaccurate mind with
    several pages of consecutive figures."</p>

    <p>"The roaring skerry and the tossing boat," appealed to him
    as they had to his grandfather before him, but they did not
    balance his dislike for the "office and the stool" or make him
    willing to devote his time and energy to working for them, so
    his university record was very poor. "No one ever played the
    truant with more deliberate care," he says, "and no one ever
    had more certificates (of attendance) for less education."</p>

    <p>One thing that he gained from his days at the university was
    the friendship of Professor Fleeming Jenkin. He was fifteen
    years older than Louis, but they had many common interests and
    the professor had much good influence over him. He was one of
    the first to see promise in his writing and encouraged him to
    go on with it.</p>

    <p>Both the professor and Mrs. Jenkin were much interested in
    dramatics and each year brought a group of friends together at
    their house for private theatricals. Stevenson was a constant
    visitor at their home, joining heartily in these plays and
    looking forward to them, although he never took any very
    important part.</p>

    <p>After Professor Jenkin's death Stevenson wrote his
    biography, and says it was a "mingled pain and pleasure to dig
    into the past of a dead friend, and find him, at every
    spadeful, shine brighter."</p>

    <p>About this time Thomas Stevenson bought Swanston Cottage in
    the Pentland Hills, about five miles from Edinburgh, and for
    the next fourteen years the family spent their summers there,
    and Louis often went out in winter as well. It ever remained
    one of his favorite spots and with Colinton stood out as a
    place that meant much in his life.</p><a name="image004"

             Cottage</span>
    </div>

    <p>These years saw great change in him; from a frank and happy
    child he had grown into a lonely, moody boy making few friends
    and shunning the social life that his father's position in
    Edinburgh offered him. He describes himself as a "lean, ugly,
    unpopular student," but those who knew him never applied the
    term "ugly" to him at any time.</p>

    <p>At Swanston he explored the hills alone and grew to know
    them so well that the Pentland country ever remained vividly in
    his memory and found its way into many of his stories, notably
    "St. Ives," where he describes Swanston as it was when they
    first made it their summer home.</p>

    <p>Many solitary winter evenings he spent there rereading his
    favorite novels, particularly Dumas's "Vicomte de Bragelonne,"
    which always pleased him. "Shakespeare has served me best," he
    said. "Few living friends have had upon me an influence so
    strong for good as Hamlet or Rosalind. Perhaps my dearest and
    best friend outside of Shakespeare is D'Artagnan, the elderly
    D'Artagnan of the 'Vicomte de Bragelonne.'</p>

    <p>"I would return in the early night from one of my patrols
    with the shepherd, a friendly face would meet me in the door, a
    friendly retriever scurry up stairs to fetch my slippers, and I
    would sit down with the Vicomte for a long, silent, solitary
    lamp-lit evening by the fire."</p>

    <p>At Swanston he first began to really write, "bad poetry," he
    says, and during his solitary rambles fought with certain
    problems that perplexed him.</p>

    <p>Here he made the acquaintance of the Scotch gardener, Robert
    Young, and John Todd, the "Roaring Shepherd, the oldest herd on
    the Pentlands," whom he accompanied on his rounds with the
    sheep, listening to his tales told in broad Scotch of the
    highland shepherds in the old days when "he himself often
    marched flocks into England, sleeping on the hillsides with his
    caravan; and by his account it was rough business not without
    danger. The drove roads lay apart from habitation; the drivers
    met in the wilderness, as to-day the deep sea fishers meet off
    the banks in the solitude of the Atlantic."</p>

    <p>All this time Louis was idling through the university,
    knowing that in the end he would make nothing of himself as an
    engineer and dreading to confess it to his father. At length,
    however, his failure in his studies came to Thomas Stevenson's
    attention, and, on being questioned about it "one dreadful day"
    as they were walking together, the boy frankly admitted that
    his heart was not with the work and he cared for nothing but to
    be able to write.</p>

    <p>While at school his father had encouraged him to follow his
    own bent in his studies and reading, but when it came to the
    point of choosing his life-work, there ought to be no question
    of doubt. The only natural thing for Louis to do was to carry
    on the great and splendid work that he himself had helped to
    build up. That the boy should have other plans of his own
    surprised and troubled him. Literature, he said, was no
    profession, and thus far Louis had not done enough to prove he
    had a claim for making it his career.</p>

    <p>After much debate it was finally decided that he should give
    up engineering, but should enter the law school and study to be
    admitted to the bar. This would not only give him an
    established profession, but leave him a little time to write as
    well.</p>

    <br>


    <p>In spite of the fact that his law studies now left him an
    opportunity for the work he wanted so much to do, Louis was far
    from happy, for between his parents and himself, who had always
    been the best of friends, there were many
    misunderstandings.</p>

    <p>Thomas Stevenson was bitterly disappointed that his only son
    should choose to be what he called "an idler"&mdash;generous to
    a fault and always out of money, dressing in a careless and
    eccentric way, which both amused and annoyed his friends and
    caused him to be ridiculed by strangers, preferring to roam the
    streets of old Edinburgh scraping acquaintance with the
    fishwives and dock hands, rather than staying at home and
    mingling in the social circle to which his parents belonged.
    But his father was still more troubled by certain independent
    religious opinions, far different from those in which he had
    been reared, that Louis adopted at this time.</p>

    <p>How any good result could come from all this neither his
    father nor mother could see, and with the loss of their
    sympathy he was thrown upon himself and was lonely and
    rebellious.</p>

    <p>He longed to get away from it all, to quit Edinburgh with
    its harsh climate, and often on his walks he leaned over the
    great bridge that joins the New Town with the Old "and watched
    the trains smoking out from under, and vanishing into the
    tunnel on a voyage to brighter skies." He longed to go with
    them "to that Somewhere-else of the imagination where all
    troubles are supposed to end."</p>

    <p>It was a comfort to him at this time to remember other
    Scotchmen, Jeffries, Burns, Fergusson, Scott, Carlyle, and
    others, who had roamed these same streets before him, not a few
    of them fighting with the same problems he faced in their
    struggle to win their ideal.</p>

    <p>This unhappy time, this "Greensickness," as he called it,
    came to an end, however, through the help of what Louis had
    always secretly longed for&mdash;friends. Several whom he met
    at this time influenced him, but first of them all he put his
    cousin Robert Alan Mowbray Stevenson (Bob), who returned to
    Edinburgh about this time from Paris, where he had been
    studying art.</p>

    <p>Louis says: "The mere return of Bob changed at once and
    forever the course of my life; I can give you an idea of my
    relief only by saying that I was at last able to breathe.... I
    was done with the sullens for good.... I had got a friend to
    laugh with."</p>

    <p>Here at last was a companion who understood him and
    sympathized with what he was trying to do. Since as children
    they had made believe together in their rival kingdoms of
    "Nosingtonia" and "Encyclopædia" they had had many traits and
    tastes in common. They now began where they had left off and
    proceeded to enjoy themselves once more by all sorts of wild
    pranks and gay expeditions.</p>

    <p>The Speculative Society became another great source of
    pleasure. It was an old society and had numbered among its
    members such men of note as Scott, Jeffrey, Robert Emmet, and
    others. Once a week from November to March the "Spec," as it
    was called, met in rooms in the University of Edinburgh. An
    essay was read and debates followed with much hot discussion,
    which delighted Stevenson. "Oh, I do think the Spec is about
    the best thing in Edinburgh," he said enthusiastically.</p>

    <p>Sir Walter Simpson, son of the famous doctor, Sir James
    Simpson, who discovered chloroform, became another chum about
    this time, and for the next ten years they were much together.
    He likewise was studying law and was a near neighbor. The
    Simpsons kept open house, and it was the custom for a group of
    cronies to drop in at all hours of day and night. Louis was
    among those who came oftenest, and Sir Walter's sister writes:
    "He would frequently drop in to dinner with us, and of an
    evening he had the run of the smoking room. After ten p.m. the
    'open sesame' to our door was a rattle on the letter box and
    Louis' fancy for the mysterious was whetted by this admittance
    by secret sign, and we liked his special rat-a-tat for it was
    the forerunner of an hour or two of talk."</p>

    <p>They teased him about his queer clothes and laughed at some
    of his wild ideas, but he seldom was angry at them for it and
    never stayed away very long.</p>

    <p>With them he often skated on Duddington Loch or canoed on
    the Firth of Forth. One summer he and Sir Walter yachted off
    the west coast of Scotland, and still another year, when
    longing for further wandering possessed them, they made a trip
    in canoes through the inland waters of Belgium from Antwerp to
    Brussels, and then into France and by the rivers Sambre and
    Oise nearly to Paris.</p>

    <p>In the "Inland Voyage," where Stevenson describes this trip,
    he calls Sir Walter and his canoe "Cigarette" while he was
    "Arethusa." Adventures were plentiful, and they aroused much
    curiosity among the dwellers on the banks, with whom they made
    friends as they went along.</p>

    <p>Once Arethusa was all but drowned, when his canoe was
    overturned by the rapids; and on several occasions, when they
    applied for a night's lodging, they were suspected of being
    tramps or peddlers because of their bedraggled appearance.</p>

    <p>One evening after a hard day's paddling in the rain they
    landed tired, wet, and hungry at the little town of La Fère.
    "The Cigarette and I could not sufficiently congratulate each
    other on the prospect," says the Arethusa, "for we had been
    told there was a capital inn at La Fère. Such a dinner as we
    were going to eat. Such beds as we were going to sleep in, and
    all the while the rain raining on homeless folk over all the
    poplared country-side. It made our mouths water. The inn bore
    the name of some woodland animal, stag, or hart, or hind, I
    forget which. But I shall never forget how spacious and how
    eminently comfortable it looked as we drew near.... A rattle of
    many dishes came to our ears; we sighted a great field of
    tablecloth; the kitchen glowed like a forge and smelt like a
    garden of things to eat.</p>

    <p>"Into this ... you are now to suppose us making our
    triumphal entry, a pair of damp rag-and-bone men, each with a
    limp india-rubber bag upon his arm. I do not believe I have a
    sound view of that kitchen; I saw it through a sort of glory,
    but it seemed to me crowded with the snowy caps of cook-men,
    who all turned round from their saucepans and looked at us with
    surprise. There was no doubt about the landlady however; there
    she was, heading her army, a flushed, angry woman, full of
    affairs. Her I asked politely&mdash;too politely, thinks the
    Cigarette&mdash;if we could have beds, she surveying us coldly
    from head to foot.</p>

    <p>"'You will find beds in the suburb,' she remarked. 'We are
    too busy for the like of you.'</p>

    <p>"If we could make an entrance, change our clothes, and order
    a bottle of wine I felt sure we could put things right, so I
    said, 'If we can not sleep, we may at least dine,' and was for
    depositing my bag.</p>

    <p>"What a terrible convulsion of nature was that which
    followed in the landlady's face! She made a run at us and
    stamped her foot.</p>

    <p>"'Out with you&mdash;out of the door!' she screeched.</p>

    <p>"I do not know how it happened, but the next moment we were
    out in the rain and darkness. This was not the first time that
    I have been refused a lodging. Often and often I have planned
    what I would do if such a misadventure happened to me again,
    and nothing is easier to plan. But to put in execution, with a
    heart boiling at the indignity? Try it, try it only once, and
    tell me what you did."</p>

    <p>Frequently on this trip the Arethusa's odd dress and foreign
    looks led him to be taken for a spy. It was not long after the
    Franco-Prussian war, and all sorts of rumors of suspicious
    characters were afloat. Once he was actually arrested and
    thrown into a dungeon because he could show no passport, and
    the commissary refused to believe he was English and puzzled
    his head over the scraps of notes and verses found in his
    knapsack.</p>

    <p>He was rescued by the faithful Cigarette, who finally
    convinced the officials that they were British gentlemen
    travelling in this odd way for pleasure, and the things in his
    friend's bag were not plans against the government, but merely
    scraps of poetry and notes on their travels that he liked to
    amuse himself by making as they went along. <a name=

       id="FNanchor__4"></a><a href="#Footnote__4"
       class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

    <p>The canoe trips ended in a visit to the artists' colony at
    Fontainebleau, where Bob Stevenson and a brother of Sir
    Walter's were spending their summer. This place always had a
    particular attraction for Louis and he spent many weeks both
    there and at Grez near by during the next few years.</p>

    <p>The free and easy life led by the artists suited him
    exactly, although he found it hard to accomplish any work of
    his own, but dreamed and planned all sorts of essays, verses,
    and tales which he never wrote, while the others put their
    pictures on canvas.</p>

    <p>"I kept always two books in my pocket," he says, "one to
    read and one to write in. As I walked my mind was busy fitting
    what I saw with appropriate words; when I sat by the roadside I
    would either read, or a pencil and penny version-book would be
    in my hand, to note down the features of the scene or
    commemorate some halting stanzas. Thus I lived with words."</p>

    <p>If there was little work, to show after a stop at
    Fontainebleau he had many memories of good-fellowship and some
    of the friends he met there were to be the first to greet him
    when he came to live on this side of the water.</p>

    <p>While on their "Inland Voyage" the two canoemen had decided
    that the most perfect mode of travel was by canal-boat. What
    could be more delightful? "The chimney smokes for dinner as you
    go along; the banks of the canal slowly unroll their scenery to
    contemplative eyes; the barge floats by great forests and
    through great cities with their public buildings and their
    lamps at night; and for the bargee, in his floating home,
    'travelling abed,' it is merely as if he were listening to
    another man's story or turning the leaves of a picture book in
    which he had no concern. He may take his afternoon walk in some
    foreign country on the banks of the canal, and then come home
    to dinner at his own fireside."</p>

    <p>They grew most enthusiastic over the idea and told one
    another how they would furnish their "water villa" with easy
    chairs, pipes, and tobacco, and the bird and the dog should go
    along too.</p>

    <p>By the time Fontainebleau was reached they had planned trips
    through all the canals of Europe. The idea took the artists'
    fancy also, and a group of them actually purchased a canal-boat
    called <i>The Eleven Thousand Virgins of Cologne</i>.
    Furnishing a water villa, however, was more expensive than they
    had foreseen, and she came to a sad end. "'The Eleven Thousand
    Virgins of Cologne' rotted in the stream where she was
    beautified ... she was never harnessed to the patient
    track-horse. And when at length she was sold, by the indignant
    carpenter of Moret, there was sold along with her the
    <i>Arethusa</i> and the <i>Cigarette</i> ... now these historic
    vessels fly the tricolor and are known by new and alien
    names."</p>

    <p>In 1873 Stevenson planned to try for admission to the
    English bar instead of the Scottish and went to London to take
    the examination. But his health, which had been rather poor,
    became worse, and on reaching London the doctor ordered him to
    Mentone in the south of France, where he had been before as a
    boy.</p>

    <p>There he spent his days principally lying on his back in the
    sun reading and playing with a little Russian girl with whom he
    struck up a great friendship. His letters to his mother were
    full of her sayings and doings. He was too ill to write much,
    although one essay, "Ordered South," was the outcome of this
    trip, the only piece of writing in which he ever posed as an
    invalid or talked of his ill health.</p>

    <p>At the end of two months he improved enough to return to
    Edinburgh, but gave up the idea of the English bar. His illness
    and absence seemed to have smoothed out some of the
    difficulties at home, and after he returned things went happier
    in every way.</p>

    <p>On July 14, 1875, he passed his final law examinations, and
    was admitted to the Scottish bar. He was now entitled to wear a
    wig and gown, place a brass plate with his name upon the door
    of 17 Heriot Row, and "have the fourth or fifth share of the
    services of a clerk" whom it is said he didn't even know by
    sight. For a few months he made some sort of a pretense at
    practising, but it amounted to very little. Gradually he ceased
    paying daily visits to the Parliament House to wait for a case,
    but settled himself instead in the room on the top floor at
    home and began to write, seriously this time&mdash;it was to be
    his life-work from now on&mdash;and the law was forgotten.</p>

    <p>His first essays were published in the <i>Cornhill
    Magazine</i> and <i>The Portfolio</i> under the initials
    R.L.S., which signature in time grew so familiar to his friends
    and to those who admired his writings it became a second name
    for him, and as R.L.S. he is often referred to.</p>

    <p>He was free now to roam as he chose and spent much time in
    Paris with Bob. The life there in the artists' quarter suited
    him as well as it had at Fontainebleau. There, among other
    American artists, he was associated with Mr. Will Low, a
    painter, whom he saw much of when he came to New York.</p>

    <p>One September he took a walking trip in the Cévenne
    Mountains with no other companion than a little gray donkey,
    Modestine, who carried his pack and tried his patience by turns
    with her pace, which was "as much slower than a walk as a walk
    is slower than a run," as he tells in the chronicle of the
    trip.</p>

    <p>A visit at Grez in 1876 was to mark a point in his life.
    Heretofore the artists' colony had been composed only of men.
    This year there were three new arrivals, Americans, a Mrs.
    Osbourne and her young son and daughter. Their home in
    California had been broken up and the mother had come to Grez
    to paint for the summer.</p>

    <p>Those who had been there for a number of years, R.L.S. among
    them, looked on the newcomers as intruders and did not hesitate
    to say so among themselves. Before the summer was over,
    however, they were obliged to confess that the newcomers had
    added to the charms of Grez, and Louis found in Mrs. Osbourne
    another companion to add to his rapidly growing list.</p>

    <p>When the artists scattered in the autumn and he returned to
    Edinburgh and Mrs. Osbourne to California, he carried with him
    the hope that some time in the future they should be
    married.</p>

    <p>For the next three years he worked hard. He published
    numerous essays in the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i> and his first
    short stories, "A Lodging for the Night," "Will O' the Mill,"
    and the "New Arabian Nights." These were followed by his first
    books of travel, "An Inland Voyage," giving a faithful account
    of the adventures of the <i>Arethusa</i> and the
    <i>Cigarette</i>, and "Travels with a Donkey in the
    Cévennes."</p>

    <p>When the latter was published, Mr. Walter Crane made an
    illustration for it showing R.L.S. under a tree in the
    foreground in his sleeping-bag, smoking, while Modestine
    contentedly crops grass by his side. Above him winds the path
    he is to take on his journey, encouraging Modestine with her
    burden to a livelier pace with his goad; receiving the blessing
    of the good monks at the Monastery of Our Lady of the Snows;
    stopping for a bite and sup at a wayside tavern; conversing
    with a fellow traveller by the way; and finally disappearing
    with the sunset over the brow of the hill.</p>

    <p>Some time previous to all this he had written in a letter:
    "Leslie Stephen, who was down here to lecture, called on me,
    and took me up to see a poor fellow, a poet who writes for him,
    and who has been eighteen months in our Infirmary, and may be
    for all I know eighteen months more. Stephen and I sat on a
    couple of chairs, and the poor fellow sat up in his bed with
    his hair and beard all tangled, and talked as cheerfully as if
    he had been in a king's palace of blue air."</p>

    <p>This was William Ernest Henley, and his brave determination
    to live and work, though he knew he must ever remain in a
    maimed condition, roused Stevenson's sincere admiration. With
    his usual impetuous generosity, he brought him books and other
    comforts to make his prolonged stay in the infirmary less
    wearisome and a warm friendship sprang up between them.</p>

    <p>As Henley grew stronger they planned to work together and
    write plays. Stevenson had done nothing of the kind since he
    was nineteen. Now they chose to use the same plot that he had
    experimented with at that time. It was the story of the
    notorious Deacon Brodie of Edinburgh, which both considered
    contained good material for a play.</p>

    <p>"A great man in his day was the Deacon; well seen in good
    society, crafty with his hands as a cabinet-maker, and one who
    could sing a song with taste. Many a citizen was proud to
    welcome the Deacon to supper, and dismiss him with regret ...
    who would have been vastly disconcerted had he known how soon,
    and in what guise his visitor returned. Many stories are told
    of this redoubtable Edinburgh burgher.... A friend of Brodie's
    ... told him of a projected visit to the country, and
    afterwards detained by some affairs, put it off and stayed the
    night in town. The good man had lain some time awake; it was
    far on in the small hours by the Tron bell; when suddenly there
    came a crack, a jar, a faint light. Softly he clambered out of
    bed and up to a false window which looked upon another room,
    and there, by the glimmer of a thieves' lantern, was his good
    friend the Deacon in a mask."</p>

    <p>At length after a certain robbery in one of the government
    offices the Deacon was suspected. He escaped to Holland, but
    was arrested in Amsterdam as he was about to start for America.
    He was brought back to Edinburgh, was tried and convicted and
    hanged on the second of October, 1788, at the west end of the
    Tolbooth, which was the famous old Edinburgh prison known as
    the Heart of Midlothian.</p><a name="image005"

    </div>

    <p>This story of Brodie had always interested Stevenson since
    he had heard it as a child, and a cabinet made by the clever
    Deacon himself formed part of the furniture of his nursery.</p>

    <p>"Deacon Brodie" and other plays were finished and produced,
    but never proved successful. Indeed, the money came in but
    slowly from any of his writings and, aside from the critics, it
    was many a long day before he was appreciated by the people of
    his own city and country. They refused to believe that "that
    daft laddie Stevenson," who had so often shocked them by his
    eccentric ways and scorn of conventions, could do anything
    worth while. So by far his happiest times were spent out of
    Scotland, principally in London, where a membership in the
    Savile Club added to his enjoyment. Here he met several
    interesting men, among them Edmund William Gosse and Sidney
    Colvin, both writers and literary critics, with whom he became
    very intimate.</p>

    <p>"My experience of Stevenson," writes Mr. Gosse, "during
    these first years was confined to London upon which he would
    make sudden piratical descents, staying a few days or weeks and
    melting into thin air again. He was much at my house, and it
    must be told that my wife and I, as young married people, had
    possessed ourselves of a house too large for our slender means
    immediately to furnish. The one person who thoroughly approved
    of our great bare absurd drawing room was Louis, who very
    earnestly dealt with us on the immorality of chairs and tables,
    and desired us to sit always, as he delighted to sit, upon
    hassocks on the floor. Nevertheless, as armchairs and settees
    straggled into existence, he handsomely consented to use them,
    although never in the usual way, but with his legs thrown
    sidewise over the arms of them, or the head of a sofa treated
    as a perch. In particular, a certain shelf with cupboards
    below, attached to a bookcase, is worn with the person of
    Stevenson, who would spend half an evening, while passionately
    discussing some question ... leaping sidewise in a seated
    posture to the length of this shelf and back again.</p>

    <p>"... These were the days when he most frequented the Savile
    Club, and the lightest and most vivacious part of him there
    came to the surface. He might spend the morning in work or
    business, and would then come to the club for luncheon. If he
    were so fortunate as to find a congenial companion disengaged,
    or to induce them to throw over their engagements, he would
    lead him off to the smoking-room, and there spend an afternoon
    in the highest spirits and the most brilliant and audacious
    talk.</p>

    <p>"He was simply bubbling with quips and jests. I am anxious
    that his laughter-loving mood should not be forgotten, because
    later on it was partly, but I think never wholly quenched, by
    ill health, responsibility and advance of years.</p>

    <p>"His private thoughts and prospects must often have been of
    the gloomiest, but he seems to have borne his unhappiness with
    a courage as high as he ever afterwards displayed."</p>

    <p>Sidney Colvin he met some time previous while visiting
    relatives in England, and their friendship was renewed when
    they met again in London; a friendship which lasted throughout
    their lives and which even the distance of two seas failed to
    obliterate. They kept up a lively correspondence and Mr. Colvin
    aided him with the publication of his writings while he was
    absent from his own country. After his death, according to
    Stevenson's wishes, Mr. Colvin edited a large collection of his
    letters and in the notes which he added paid his friend many
    splendid tributes which show him to be a fair critic as well as
    an ardent admirer. "He had only to speak," he says, "in order
    to be recognized in the first minute for a witty and charming
    gentleman, and within the first five minutes for a master
    spirit and man of genius."</p>

    <p>Louis's long absences from home often troubled his mother
    and caused her to complain when writing. In one answer to her
    about this time he said:</p>

    <p>"You must not be vexed at my absences, you must understand I
    shall be a nomad, more or less, until my days be done. You
    don't know how much I used to long for it in the old days; how
    I used to go and look at the trains leaving, and wish to go
    with them. And now, you know, that I have a little more that is
    solid under my feet, you must take my nomadic habit as a part
    of me. Just wait till I am in swing and you will see that I
    shall pass more of my life with you than elsewhere; only take
    me as I am and give me time. I <i>must</i> be a bit of a
    vagabond."</p>

    <p>For all so little of his writing was ever done in his own
    country, nevertheless he turned to Scotland again and again for
    the setting of his stories and the subject of his essays.
    Although he often spoke harshly of Edinburgh when at home, he
    paid her many loving tributes in writing of her in a foreign
    land: "The quaint grey-castled city where the bells clash of a
    Sunday, and the wind squalls, and the salt showers fly and
    beat.... I do not even know if I desire to live there, but let
    me hear in some far land a kindred voice sing out 'Oh, why left
    I my hame?' and it seems at once as if no beauty under the kind
    heavens, and no society of the wise and good, can repay me for
    my absence from my own country. And although I think I would
    rather die elsewhere, yet in my heart of hearts I long to be
    buried among good Scotch clods. I will say it fairly, it grows
    on me with every year; there are no stars so lovely as the
    Edinburgh street lamps. When I forget thee, Auld Reekie, may my
    right hand forget its cunning."</p>

    <h3>AMATEUR EMIGRANT</h3>

    <p class="poem">"Hope went before them
    <br>
     And the world was wide."</p>
    <br>


    <p>In the summer of 1879 R.L.S. was once more seized with the
    desire to roam and to roam farther than ever before. California
    had been beckoning to him for some time, and in August he
    suddenly made up his mind, and with scarcely a word of farewell
    to his family and friends he embarked on the steamship
    <i>Devonia</i>, bound for New York.</p>

    <p>Partly for the sake of economy, for he determined to pay his
    own way on this venture, and partly because he was anxious to
    experience emigrant life, he engaged passage in the second
    cabin, which in those days differed very little from the
    steerage. The main advantages were a trifle better food and a
    cabin to himself with a table where he could write.</p>

    <p>In his usual way he soon made acquaintance with his fellow
    passengers and did them many a friendly turn. They took him for
    one of themselves and showed little curiosity as to where he
    came from, who he was, or where he was going. He says: "The
    sailors called me 'mate,' the officers addressed me as 'my
    man,' my comrades accepted me without hesitation for a person
    of their own character and experience. One, a mason himself,
    believed I was a mason, several, among these at least one of
    the seamen, judged me to be a petty officer in the American
    navy; and I was so often set down for a practical engineer that
    at last I had not the heart to deny it."</p>

    <p>The emigrants were from many countries, though the majority
    were Scotch and Irish bound for the new world with the hope of
    meeting with better fortune than they had had in the old, and
    they whiled away the days at sea in their several ways, making
    the best of their discomforts and cheering one another when
    they grew lonely or homesick for those they had left
    behind.</p>

    <p>When the weather was good their spirits rose and there were
    many rounds of singing and story-telling as they sat clustered
    together like bees under the lee of the deck-house, and in all
    of these Stevenson joined heartily.</p>

    <p>"We were indeed a musical ship's company," he says, "and
    cheered our way into exile with the fiddle, the accordion, and
    the songs of all nations, good, bad or
    indifferent&mdash;Scottish, English, Irish, Russian or
    Norse&mdash;the songs were received with generous applause.
    Once or twice, a recitation, very spiritedly rendered in a
    powerful Scotch accent, varied the proceedings; and once we
    sought in vain to dance a quadrille, eight men of us together,
    to the music of the violin. The performers were humorous,
    frisky fellows, who loved to cut capers in private life; but as
    soon as they were arranged for the dance, they conducted
    themselves like so many mutes at a funeral. I have never seen
    decorum pushed so far; and as this was not expected, the
    quadrille was soon whistled off, and the dancers departed.</p>

    <p>"But the impulse to sing was strong, and triumphed over
    modesty and even the inclemencies of the sea and sky. On one
    rough Saturday night, we got together by the main deck-house,
    in a place sheltered from the wind and rain. Some clinging to
    the ladder which led to the hurricane-deck and the rest
    knitting arms or taking hands, we made a ring to support the
    women in the violent lurching of the ship, and when we were
    thus disposed, sang to our hearts' content.</p>

    <p>"There was a single chess-board and a single pack of cards.
    Sometimes as many as twenty of us would be playing dominoes for
    love. There were feats of dexterity, puzzles for the
    intelligence and a regular daily competition to guess the
    vessel's progress; at twelve o'clock when the result was
    published in the wheel house, came to be a moment of
    considerable interest.... We had beside, romps in plenty. Puss
    in the Corner, which we rebaptized, in more manly style, Devil
    and Four Corners, was my favorite game; but there were many who
    preferred another, the humor of which was to box a person's
    ears until he found out who cuffed him."</p>

    <p>The voyage, which lasted ten days, was uneventful except for
    some rough weather when Stevenson found his cabin most stuffy
    and uncomfortable. He was not really ill, however, and spent
    much of the time finishing a tale called "The Story of a Lie,"
    while his table played "Bob Jerry with the ink bottle." On his
    arrival in New York the story was sent back to London with the
    following letter to Sidney Colvin:</p>
    <br>


    <p class="address">"On Board S.S. Devonia an hour or two out of
    New York, Aug., 1879.</p>

    <p class="sc">"My dear Colvin:</p>

    <p>"I have finished my story. The handwriting is not good
    because of the ship's misconduct; thirty-one pages in ten days
    at sea is not bad. I am not very well; bad food, bad air and
    hard work have brought me down. But the spirits keep good. The
    voyage has been most interesting and will make, if not a series
    of Pall Mall articles, at least the first part of a new book.
    The last weight on me has been trying to keep notes for this
    purpose. Indeed I have worked like a horse and am tired as a
    donkey. If I should have to push on far by rail, I shall bring
    nothing but my fine bones to port.</p>

    <p>"Goodbye to you all. I suppose it is now late afternoon with
    you all across the seas. What shall I find over here? I dare
    not wonder.&mdash;Ever yours &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    R.L.S."</p>
    <br>


    <p>As California was the goal he aimed for, in spite of his
    fatigue after ten days of poor living and the sea, he
    determined to push on immediately in an emigrant train bound
    for the Pacific coast.</p>

    <p>On reaching port he and a man named Jones, with whom he had
    had more in common than with any of his other fellow
    passengers, landed together.</p>

    <p>"Jones and I issued into West Street, sitting on some straw
    in the bottom of an open baggage wagon. It rained miraculously,
    and from that moment till on the following night I left New
    York, there was scarce a lull, and no cessation of the
    downpour....</p>

    <p>"It took but a few moments, though it cost a good deal of
    money, to be rattled along West Street to our destination:
    Reunion House, No. 10 West Street, 'kept by one Mitchell.'</p>

    <p>"Here I was at last in America and was soon out upon the New
    York streets, spying for things foreign....</p>

    <p>"The following day I had a thousand and one things to do;
    only the day to do them in and a journey across the continent
    before me in the evening.... It rained with potent fury; every
    now and then I had to get under cover for a while in order, so
    to speak, to give my mackintosh a rest; for under this
    continued drenching it began to grow damp on the inside. I went
    to banks, post-offices, railway offices, restaurants,
    publishers, book sellers and money changers.</p>

    <p>"I was so wet when I got back to Mitchell's toward evening,
    that I had simply to divest myself of my shoes, socks and
    trousers, and leave them behind for the benefit of New York
    City. No fire could have dried them ere I had to start; and to
    pack them in their present condition was to spread ruin among
    my other possessions. With a heavy heart I said farewell to
    them as they lay a pulp in the middle of a pool upon the floor
    of Mitchell's kitchen. I wonder if they are dry by now."</p>

    <p>That night he joined a party of emigrants bound for the
    West, the weight of his baggage much increased by the result of
    his day's purchases&mdash;Bancroft's "History of the United
    States" in six fat volumes. So in less than twenty-four hours
    after landing on one coast he was on his way to the other.</p>

    <p>If at times he had been uncomfortable on the steamer he was
    ten times more so on the train. It is hard to realize in these
    days of easy travelling what the discomforts of riding in the
    emigrant trains were; crowded together in badly lighted, badly
    ventilated cars, with stiff wooden benches on either side,
    which were most uncomfortable to sit on and next to impossible
    to lie down upon. Meals were taken as best they might when they
    stopped at way stations while some bought milk and eggs and
    made a shift to cook themselves a meal or brew a cup of tea on
    the stove at the end of the car.</p>

    <p>Over a week of this sort of slow travelling through the heat
    of the plains was enough to tax the strength and courage of the
    most robust man, let alone one in as delicate health as
    Stevenson at that time, and it is a wonder he ever lived
    through it. Indeed, he was ill but kept cheerful in spite of
    all, and was interested in the country and the sights along the
    way. His own discomforts seemed to dwindle when he contrasted
    them with those the pioneers endured travelling that same
    direction twenty years before; crawling along in ox-carts with
    their cattle and family possessions; suffering hunger, thirst,
    and infinite weariness, and living in daily terror of attack
    from the Indians.</p>

    <p>He made note of all he saw and the doings of his fellow
    emigrants, to be used later on. Letters to Henley and Colvin en
    route are interesting.</p>

    is heard singing with cicadae. This is a pause, as you may see
    from the writing. What happened to the old pedestrian
    emigrants; what was the tedium suffered by the Indians and
    trappers of our youth, the imagination trembles to conceive.
    This is now Saturday, 23rd, and I have been steadily travelling
    since I parted from you at St. Pancras. It is a strange
    vicissitude from the Savile Club to this; I sleep with a man
    from Pennsylvania who has been in the Navy Yard, and mess with
    him and the Missouri bird already alluded to. We have a tin
    wash-bowl among four, I wear nothing but a shirt and a pair of
    trousers and never button my shirt. When I land for a meal, I
    pass my coat and feel dressed. This life is to last until
    Friday, Saturday or Sunday next. It is a strange affair to be
    an emigrant, as I hope you shall see in a future work. I wonder
    if this will be legible; my present station on the wagon roof,
    though airy, compared to the cars, is both dirty and insecure.
    I can see the track straight before and straight behind me to
    either horizon....</p>

    <p>"Our journey is through ghostly deserts, sage brush and
    alkali, and rocks without form or color, a sad corner of the
    world. I confess I am not jolly, but mighty calm, in my
    distresses. My illness is a subject of great mirth to some of
    my fellow travellers, and I smile rather sickly at their
    jests.</p>

    <p>"We are going along Bitter Creek just now, a place infamous
    in the history of emigration, a place I shall remember myself
    among the blackest.&mdash;R.L.S."</p>
    <br>


    <p>When California was finally reached he decided to rest and
    recover strength by camping out for a few days in the Coast
    Range Mountains beyond Monterey, but the anxiety and strain of
    the long journey had been greater than he realized, and he
    broke down and became very ill. For two nights he lay out under
    the trees in a kind of stupor and at length was rescued by two
    frontiersmen in charge of a goat-ranch, who took him to their
    cabin and cared for him until he partly recovered.</p>

    <p>"Here is another curious start in my life," he wrote to
    Sidney Colvin. "I am living at an Angora goat-ranch, in the
    Coast Line Mountains, eighteen miles from Monterey. I was
    camping out, but got so sick that the two rancheros took me in
    and tended me. One is an old bear hunter, seventy-two years
    old, and a captain from the Mexican War; the other a pilgrim,
    and one who was out with the bear flag and under Fremont when
    California was taken by the States. They are both true
    frontiersmen, and most kind and pleasant. Captain Smith, the
    bear hunter, is my physician, and I obey him like an
    oracle....</p>

    <p>"I am now lying in an upper chamber, with the clinking of
    goat bells in my ears, which proves to me that the goats are
    come home and it will soon be time to eat. The old bear hunter
    is doubtless now infusing tea; and Tom the Indian will come in
    with his gun in a few moments....</p>

    <p>"The business of my life stands pretty nigh still. I work at
    my notes of the voyage. It will not be very like a book of
    mine; but perhaps none the less successful for that. I will not
    deny that I feel lonely to-day.... I have not yet had a word
    from England, partly, I suppose, because I have not yet written
    for my letters to New York; do not blame me for this neglect,
    if you knew all I have been through, you would wonder I had
    done as much as I have. I teach the ranch children reading in
    the morning, for the mother is from home sick.</p>

    <p class="address">"Ever your affectionate friend.
    <br>
     "R.L.S."</p>
    <br>


    <p>As soon as Stevenson was well enough he returned to Monterey
    and fell to working upon several short stories and the notes of
    his voyage, which he brought together and published later under
    the titles "The Amateur Emigrant" and "Across the Plains."</p>

    <p>Monterey in those days was a small Mexican town; "a place of
    two or three streets economically paved with sea-sand, and two
    or three lanes, which were the water courses in the rainy
    season.... The houses were, for the most part, built of unbaked
    adobe brick....</p>

    <p>"There was no activity but in and around the saloons, where
    the people sat almost all day playing cards. The smallest
    excursion was made on horseback. You would scarcely ever see
    the main street without a horse or two tied to posts, and
    making a fine figure with their Mexican housings. In a place so
    exclusively Mexican as Monterey, you saw not only Mexican
    saddles, but true Vaquero riding&mdash;men always at a hand
    gallop, up hill and down dale, and round the sharpest corners,
    urging their horses with cries and gesticulations and cruel
    rotary spurs, checking them dead, with a touch, or wheeling
    them right about face in a square yard. Spanish was the
    language of the street."</p>

    <p>He lodged with a doctor and his wife, and took his meals at
    the little restaurant kept by Jules Simoneau, "a most pleasant
    old boy," with whom he played chess and discussed the universe
    daily.</p>

    <p>About the middle of December he pushed on to San Francisco,
    and prepared to settle down and work for an indefinite time.
    Though he had known but few people in Monterey, nevertheless it
    was a social little place in comparison to a great city like
    San Francisco, where Stevenson found himself indeed a stranger
    and friendless and learned for the first time in his life what
    it really meant to be lonely.</p>

    <p>Funds were running low; so he secured the cheapest possible
    lodging and took his meals at various small restaurants, living
    at the rate of seventy cents a day.</p>

    <p>On December 26 he wrote: "For four days I have spoken to no
    one but my landlady or landlord or the restaurant waiters. This
    is not a gay way to pass Christmas, is it?" But some days
    later, nothing daunted, he added: "I lead a pretty happy life,
    though you might not think it. I have great fun trying to be
    economical, which I find as good a game of play as any other. I
    have no want of occupation and though I rarely see any one to
    speak to, have little time to worry."</p>

    <p>To make matters worse, letters containing money went astray
    and word came that some articles submitted to his publishers in
    England, on which he had depended for funds, were not
    satisfactory, and this forced him to reduce his living expenses
    to forty-five cents a day. The letters from home were most
    unsatisfactory and lacked the kind of news he longed for. "Not
    one soul ever gives me any <i>news</i>," he complained to
    Sidney Colvin, "about people or things, everybody writes me
    sermons; it is good for me, but hardly the food necessary for a
    man who lives all alone on forty-five cents a day, and
    sometimes less, with quantities of hard work and many heavy
    thoughts. If one of you could write me a letter with a jest in
    it, a letter like what is written to real people in the
    world&mdash;I am still flesh and blood&mdash;I should enjoy it.
    Simpson did the other day, and it did me as much good as a
    bottle of wine&mdash;man alive I want gossip."</p>

    <p>Day in and day out he worked doggedly, fighting
    discouragement, with little strength or inspiration to write
    anything very worth while.</p>

    <p>To cap all, his landlady's little boy fell ill, and
    Stevenson, who had a great love and sympathy for all children,
    helped to nurse him, and this proved too much in the nervous
    and exhausted state he was in. The boy recovered, but Stevenson
    fell ill again, and for six weeks hovered between life and
    death.</p>

    <p>This seems to have been the turning-point in his ill luck.
    Toward the middle of February, as he slowly began to mend, he
    was cheered on by long letters from home, full of anxiety for
    his health and advances of money from his father, with strict
    instructions that from now on he was no longer to stint and
    deny himself the bare necessities of life, as he had been
    doing. Later, in April, came a telegram from Thomas Stevenson
    saying that in future Louis was to count on an income of two
    hundred and fifty pounds a year.</p>

    <p>Cheered with the prospect of an easier road ahead of him, he
    struggled back to life once more with a strong resolve to work
    harder and make those at home proud of him.</p>

    <p>"It was a considerable shock to my pride to break down," he
    wrote to a friend, "but there it's done and can not be helped.
    Had my health held out another month, I should have made a
    year's income, but breaking down when I did, I am surrounded by
    unfinished works. It is a good thing my father was on the spot,
    or I should have had to work and die."</p>

    <p>Early in the spring he and Mrs. Osbourne met again, and on
    May 19, 1880, they were married in San Francisco.</p>

    <p>For the rest of his life Stevenson had no cause to complain
    of loneliness, for in his wife he had an "inseparable sharer of
    all his adventures; the most open-hearted of friends to all
    those who loved him; the most shrewd and stimulating critic of
    his work; and in sickness, despite her own precarious health,
    the most devoted and most efficient of nurses."</p>

    <p>Immediately after their marriage Stevenson and his wife and
    stepson&mdash;and the dog&mdash;went to the Coast Range
    Mountains and, taking possession of an old deserted miner's
    camp, practically lived out-of-doors for the next few months,
    with no neighbors aside from a hunter and his family.</p>

    <p>This was healthy, but the life of a squatter has its
    limitations, and their trials and tribulations during these
    weeks Stevenson told most amusingly in "The Silverado
    Squatters."</p>

    <p>Gradually a longing began to come to R.L.S. to see those at
    home once more and have them know his wife. This desire grew so
    from day to day that July found them bidding good-by to
    California, and on the 7th of August they sailed from New York
    for Liverpool.</p>

    <h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI"
       id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

    <h3>SCOTLAND AGAIN</h3>

    <p class="poem">"Bells upon the city are ringing in the night,
    <br>
     High above the gardens are the houses full of light,
    <br>
     On the heathy Pentlands is the curlew flying free,
    <br>
     And the broom is blowing bonnie in the north countrie.</p>

    <p class="poem">"We canna break the bonds that God decreed to
    bind,
    <br>
     Still we'll be the children of the heather and the wind,
    <br>
     Far away from home O, it's still for you and me
    <br>
     That the broom is blowing bonnie in the north countrie."</p>
    <br>


    <p>On his return to Scotland the spell of his own land fell
    upon R.L.S. for the first time. He realized now how he loved it
    spite of its bad climate, how much there was at home waiting
    for him. "After all," he said, "new countries, sun, music, and
    all the rest, can never take down our gusty, rainy, smoky, grim
    old city out of the first place it has been making for itself
    in the bottom of my soul."</p>

    <p>But he had returned only to be banished. The doctors found
    his lungs too weak to risk Edinburgh winters and advised him to
    try the Alps.</p>

    <p>Accordingly a cottage was rented in Davos Platz, a health
    resort. There and at similar places near by they spent the next
    few winters with visits to England and France between.
    Switzerland never suited Stevenson. He disliked living among
    invalids, and with his love for exploring the nooks and corners
    of any spot he was in he felt like a prisoner when he found
    himself shut in a valley among continual snow with few walks
    possible for him to take. "The mountains are about me like a
    trap," he complained. "You can not foot it up a hillside and
    behold the sea on a great plain, but live in holes and corners
    and can change only one for the other."</p>

    <p>Tobogganing was the only sport of Davos Platz he really
    enjoyed, and he pursued that to his heart's content. "Perhaps
    the true way to toboggan is alone and at night," he said.
    "First comes the tedious climb dragging your instrument behind
    you. Next a long breathing space, alone with the snow and pine
    woods, cold, silent and solemn to the heart. Then you push off;
    the toboggan fetches away, she begins to feel the hill, to
    glide, to swim, to gallop. In a breath you are out from under
    the pine-trees and the whole heaven full of stars reels and
    flashes overhead."</p>

    <p>He accomplished little work at this time. Sometimes for days
    he would be unable to write at all. But the little boy who had
    once told his mother, "I have been trying to make myself
    happy," was the same man now who could say: "I was never bored
    in my life." When unable to do anything else he would build
    houses of cards or lie in bed and model little figures in clay.
    Anything to keep his hands busy and his mind distracted from
    the stories that crowded his brain and he had not strength to
    put on paper. His one horror, the fear that urged him on to
    work feverishly when he was suffering almost beyond endurance,
    was the thought that his illness might one day make him a
    helpless invalid.</p>

    <p>The splendid part to think of is that no hint of his dark
    days and pains crept into his writings or saddened those who
    came to see him. Complaint he kept to himself, prayed that he
    might "continue to be eager to be happy," lived with the best
    that was in him from day to day, and the words that went forth
    from his sick-room have cheered and encouraged thousands.</p>

    <p>When asked why he wrote so many stories of pirates and
    adventurers with few women to soften them he replied: "I
    suppose it's the contrast; I have always admired great
    strength, even in a pirate. Courage has interested me more than
    anything else."</p>

    <p>He and his stepson had grown to be great chums. At Silverado
    Lloyd had been seized with a desire to write stories and had
    set up a toy printing-press which turned off several tales. At
    Davos Platz they both tried their hand at illustrating these
    stories with pictures cut on wood-blocks and gayly colored.
    Lloyd's room was quite a gallery of these artistic attempts.
    But their favorite diversion was to play at a war game with
    lead soldiers. In after-years Lloyd wrote his recollections of
    the days they spent together enjoying this fun and he says:
    "The war game was constantly improved and elaborated, until
    from a few hours, a war took weeks to play, and the critical
    operations in the attic monopolized half our thoughts. This
    attic was a most chilly and dismal spot, reached by a crazy
    ladder, and unlit save for a single frosted window; so low at
    the eaves and so dark that we could seldom stand upright, nor
    see without a candle. Upon the attic floor a map was roughly
    drawn in chalks of different colors, with mountains, rivers,
    towns, bridges, and roads of two classes. Here we would play by
    the hour, with tingling fingers and stiffening knees, and an
    intentness, zest, and excitement that I shall never forget.</p>

    <p>"The mimic battalions marched and counter-marched, changed
    by measured evolutions from column formation into line, with
    cavalry screens in front and massed support behind, in the most
    approved military fashion of to-day."</p>

    <p>Neither of them ever grew too old for this sport. Year after
    year they went back to the game. Even when they went to Samoa
    they laid out a campaign room with maps chalked on the
    floor.</p>

    <p>In the spring of 1885 Thomas Stevenson purchased a house at
    Bournemouth, England, near London, as a present for his
    daughter-in-law.</p>

    <p>They named the cottage "Skerryvore," after the famous
    lighthouse he had helped to build in his young days, and it was
    their home for the next three years&mdash;busy ones for
    R.L.S.</p><a name="image006"

             "caption">Skerryvore Cottage, Bournemouth</span>
    </div>

    <p>It was a real joy to have his father and mother and Bob
    Stevenson with them again and his friends in London frequently
    drop in for a visit.</p>

    <p>His health was never worse than during the Bournemouth days.
    He seldom went beyond his own garden-gate but lived, as he
    says, "like a weevil in a biscuit." Yet he never worked harder
    or accomplished more. He wrote in bed and out of bed, sick or
    well, poems, plays, short stories, and verses.</p>

    <p>He finished "Treasure Island," the book that gained him his
    first popularity, and wrote "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," which
    made him famous at home and abroad.</p>

    <p>"Treasure Island" had been started some time previous to
    please Lloyd, who asked him to write a "good story." It all
    began with a map. Stevenson always loved maps, and one day
    during a picture-making bout he had drawn a fine one. "It was
    elaborately and (I thought) beautifully colored," he says. "The
    shape of it took my fancy beyond expression; it contained
    harbors that pleased me like sonnets.... I ticketed my
    performance Treasure Island."</p>

    <p>Immediately the island began to take life and swarm with
    people, all sorts of strange scenes began to take place upon
    it, and as he gazed at his map Stevenson discovered the plot
    for the "good story."</p>

    <p>"It is horrid fun," he wrote, "and begins in the Admiral
    Benbow public house on the Devon coast; all about a map and a
    treasure and a mutiny, and a derelict ship ... and a doctor and
    a sea-cook with one leg with the chorus 'yo-ho-ho and a bottle
    of rum,' ... No women in the story, Lloyd orders."</p>

    <p>Parts of the coast at Monterey flashed back to his mind and
    helped him to picture the scenery of his "Treasure Island." "It
    was just such a place as the Monterey sand hills the hero John
    Hawkins found himself on leaving his mutinous shipmates. It was
    just such a thicket of live oak growing low along the sand like
    brambles, that he crawled and dodged when he heard the voices
    of the pirates near him and saw Long John Silver strike down
    with his crutch one of his mates who had refused to join in his
    plan for murder."</p><a name="image007"

             "caption">The Treasure Island map</span>
    </div>

    <p>As the story grew he read each new chapter aloud to the
    family in the evening. He was writing it for one boy, but found
    he had more in his audience. "My father," he says, "not only
    heard with delight the daily chapter, but set himself actively
    to collaborate. When the time came for Billy Bones' chest to be
    ransacked, he must have passed the better part of a day
    preparing on the back of a legal envelope an inventory of its
    contents, which I exactly followed, and the name of Flint's old
    ship, the Walrus, was given at his particular request."</p>

    <p>When the map was redrawn for the book it was embellished
    with "blowing whales and sailing ships; and my father himself
    brought into service a knack he had of various writing, and
    elaborately <i>forged</i> the signature of Captain Flint and
    the sailing directions of Billy Bones."</p>

    <p>These daily readings were rare treats to those at
    Skerryvore, for Stevenson was a most dramatic reader. "When he
    came to stand in the place of Silver you could almost have
    imagined you saw the great one-legged John Silver, joyous-eyed,
    on the rolling sea."</p>

    <p>The book was not long in springing into popularity. Not only
    the boys enjoyed it but all sorts of staid and sober men became
    boys once more and sat up long after bedtime to finish the
    tale. Mr. Gladstone caught a glimpse of it at a friend's house
    and did not rest the next day until he had procured a copy for
    himself, and Andrew Lang said: "This is the kind of stuff a
    fellow wants. I don't know when, except Tom Sawyer and the
    Odyssey, that I ever liked a romance so well."</p>

    <p>It was translated into many different languages, even
    appearing serially in certain Greek and Spanish papers.</p>

    <p>"Kidnapped" followed; a story founded on the Appan murder.
    David Balfour, the hero, was one of his own ancestors; Alan
    Breck had actually lived, and the Alison who ferried Alan and
    David over to Torryburn was one of Cummie's own people. The
    Highland country where the scenes were laid, he had traversed
    many times, and the Island of Earraid, where David was
    shipwrecked, was the spot where he had spent some of his
    engineering days.</p>

    <p>Stevenson had often said the "brownies" in his dreams gave
    him ideas for his tales. At Skerryvore they came to him with a
    story that among all his others is counted the greatest.</p>

    <p>"In the small hours one morning," says his wife, "I was
    awakened by cries of horror from Louis. Thinking he had a
    nightmare I awakened him. He said angrily, 'Why did you wake
    me? I was dreaming a fine bogey tale.'"</p>

    <p>The dream was so vivid that he could not rest until he had
    written off the story, and it so possessed him that the first
    draft was finished within three days. It was called "The
    Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."</p>

    <p>This story instantly created much discussion. Articles were
    written about it, sermons were preached on it, and letters
    poured in from all sorts of people with their theories about
    the strange tale. Six months after it was published nearly
    forty thousand copies were sold in England alone; but its
    greatest success was in America where its popularity was
    immediate and its sale enormous.</p>

    <p>One day he was attracted by a book of verses about children
    by Kate Greenaway, and wondered why he could not write some too
    of the children he remembered best of all. Scenes and doings in
    the days spent at Colinton with his swarm of cousins; the games
    they had played and the people they had known all trooped back
    with other memories of Edinburgh days. As he recalled these
    children, they tripped from his pen until he had a delightful
    collection of verses and determined to bring them together in a
    book.</p>

    <p>First he called it "The Penny Whistle," but soon changed the
    title to "A Child's Garden of Verses" and dedicated it, with
    the following poem, to the only one he said who would really
    understand the verses, the one who had done so much to make his
    childhood days happy:</p>
    <br>

    <p>"Of course," he said, speaking of this dedication when he
    wrote to Cummie about the book, "this is only a flourish, like
    taking off one's hat, but still a person who has taken the
    trouble to write things does not dedicate them to anyone
    without meaning it; and you must try to take this dedication in
    place of a great many things that I might have said, and that I
    ought to have done; to prove that I am not altogether
    unconscious of the great debt of gratitude I owe
    you."</p><a name="image008"

    <p>If Thomas Stevenson had been one of the first to doubt his
    boy's literary ability, he was equally quick to acknowledge
    himself mistaken. He was proud of his brilliant son, keenly
    interested in whatever he was working on and, during the days
    spent together at Skerryvore, gave him valuable aid in his
    writing.</p>

    <p>To have this old-time comradeship with his father, to enjoy
    his sympathy and understanding once more was Stevenson's
    greatest joy at this time; a joy which he sorrowfully realized
    he must soon part with forever as his father's health was
    failing rapidly.</p>

    <p>Thomas Stevenson remained at Skerryvore until April, 1887,
    when he left for a short visit to Edinburgh. While there he
    became suddenly worse and died on the 8th of May.</p>

    <p>Louis's greatest reason for remaining in England was gone
    now, and he determined to cross the ocean with his family once
    more.</p>

    <p>His mother willingly gave up her home, her family, her
    friends, and the comforts she had always enjoyed to go with him
    to a new country, on any venture he might propose if his health
    could only be improved thereby.</p>

    <p>On August 21, 1887, Louis bade good-by to Scotland for the
    last time and sailed away from London on the steamship
    <i>Ludgate Hill</i> for New York.</p>

    <h3>SECOND VISIT TO AMERICA</h3>

    <p class="blockquot">"Tis a good land to fall in with men, and
    a pleasant land to see."</p>

    <p class="blockquot"><span style=
    "text-align: right;">&mdash;(<i>Words spoken by Hendrik Hudson
    when he first brought his ship through the Narrows and saw the
    Bay of New York</i>.)</span></p>
    <br>


    <p>Stevenson's second landing in New York was a great contrast
    to his first. The "Amateur Emigrant" had no one to bid him
    welcome and Godspeed but a West Street tavern-keeper, and now
    when Mr. Will Low, his old friend of Fontainebleau days,
    hastened to the dock to welcome him on the <i>Ludgate Hill</i>,
    he found the author of "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" already
    surrounded by reporters.</p>

    <p>The trip had done him good in spite of their passage having
    been an unusually rough one, with numerous discomforts. The
    <i>Ludgate Hill</i> was not an up-to-date liner and she carried
    a very mixed cargo. The very fact of her being a tramp ship and
    that the passengers were free to be about with the men and
    officers, stay in the wheel-house, and enjoy a real sea life,
    delighted Stevenson, and he wrote back to Sidney Colvin:</p>

    <p>"I enjoyed myself more than I could have hoped on board our
    floating menagerie; stallions and monkeys and matches made our
    cargo; and the vast continent of the incongruities rolled the
    while like a haystack; and the stallions stood hypnotized by
    the motion, looking through the port at our dinner table, and
    winnied when the crockery was broken; and the little monkeys
    stared at one another in their cages ... and the big monkey,
    Jacko scoured about the ship and rested willingly in my arms
    ... the other passengers, when they were not sick, looked on
    and laughed. Take all this picture, and make it roll till the
    bell shall sound unexpected notes and the fittings shall break
    loose in our state rooms, and you have the voyage of the
    Ludgate Hill. She arrived in the port of New York without beer,
    porter, soda-water, curaçoa, fresh meat, or fresh water, and
    yet we lived and we regret her."</p>

    <p>After a short visit with friends in Newport they returned to
    New York and settled down for a time in the Hotel St. Stephen,
    on 11th Street, near University Place, to make plans for their
    winter's trip.</p>

    <p>Soon after their arrival "Jekyll and Hyde" was dramatized
    and produced with great success. When it was known that the
    author of this remarkable story was in the city, people flocked
    from all sides to call on him, and fairly wearied him with
    their attentions, although he liked to see them and made many
    interesting acquaintances at the time.</p>

    <p>Washington Square was one of his favorite spots in New York,
    and he spent many hours there watching the children playing
    about. A day he always recalled with special pleasure was the
    one when he had spent a whole forenoon in the Square talking
    with Mark Twain.</p>

    <p>Among those who were anxious to know Stevenson was the
    American sculptor Augustus St. Gaudens. He had been delighted
    with his writings and regretted he had not met him in Paris
    when he and Mr. Low had been there together. "If Stevenson ever
    comes to New York," he said to Mr. Low, "I want to meet him,"
    and added that he would consider it a great privilege if
    Stevenson would permit him to make his portrait.</p>

    <p>It was with much pleasure, therefore, that Mr. Low brought
    them together, and they took to one another immediately. "I
    like your sculptor. What a splendid straightforward and simple
    fellow he is," said Stevenson; and St. Gaudens's comment after
    their first meeting was: "Astonishingly young, not a bit like
    an invalid and a bully fellow."</p>

    <p>Stevenson readily consented to sit for his portrait, and
    they spent many delightful hours together while the sketches
    were being made for it.</p>

    <p>One day the sculptor brought his eight-year-old son, Homer,
    with him, and years afterward gave the following description of
    the child's visit:</p>

    <p>"On the way I endeavored to impress on the boy the fact that
    he was about to see a man whom he must remember all his life.
    It was a lovely day and as I entered the room Stevenson lay as
    usual on rather a high bed. I presented Homer to him ... but
    since my son's interest, notwithstanding my injunctions, was to
    say the least far from enthusiastic, I sent him out to
    play.</p><a name="image009"

    </div>

    <p>"I then asked Stevenson to pose but that was not successful
    ... all the gestures being forced and affected. Therefore I
    suggested to him that if he would try to write, some natural
    attitude might result. He assented and taking a sheet of paper
    ... he pulled his knees up and began. Immediately his attitude
    was such that I was enabled to create something of use and
    continued drawing while he wrote with an occasional smile.
    Presently I finished and told him there was no necessity for
    his writing any more. He did not reply but proceeded for quite
    a while. Then he folded the paper with deliberation, placed it
    in an envelope, addressed it, and handed it to me. It was to
    'Master Homer St. Gaudens.'</p>

    <p>"I asked him: 'Do you wish me to give this to the boy?'</p>

    <p>"'Yes,'</p>

    <p>"'When? Now?'</p>

    <p>"'Oh, no, in five or ten years, or when I am dead.'</p>

    <p>"I put it in a safe and here it is:</p>
    <br>


    <p class="address">"May 27, 1888.</p>

    <p>"<span class="sc">Dear Homer St. Gaudens</span>&mdash;Your
    father has brought you this day to see me and tells me it is
    his hope you may remember the occasion. I am going to do what I
    can to carry out his wish; and it may amuse you, years after,
    to see this little scrap of paper and to read what I write. I
    must begin by testifying that you yourself took no interest
    whatever in the introduction, and in the most proper spirit
    displayed a single-minded ambition to get back to play, and
    this I thought an excellent and admirable point in your
    character. You were also,&mdash;I use the past tense with a
    view to the time when you shall read rather than to that when I
    am writing,&mdash;a very pretty boy, and to my European views
    startlingly self-possessed. My time of observation was so
    limited that you must pardon me if I can say no more ... but
    you may perhaps like to know that the lean, flushed man in bed,
    who interested you so little, was in a state of mind extremely
    mingled and unpleasant; harassed with work which he thought he
    was not doing well, troubled with difficulties to which you
    will in time succeed, and yet looking forward to no less a
    matter than a voyage to the South Seas and the visitation of
    savage and desert islands.</p>

    <p class="center">"Your father's friend,</p>

    <p class="address"
       style="margin-top:-0.8em;"><span class="sc">"Robert Louis
       Stevenson."</span></p>
    <br>


    <p>The portrait was finished in bas-relief and many copies were
    made of it. The most familiar is the one giving only
    Stevenson's head and shoulders, but the splendid big one placed
    as a memorial to him in St. Giles's Cathedral in Edinburgh
    shows him as he must have looked that day lying in bed, writing
    to Homer St. Gaudens.</p>

    <p>Another man in New York whom Stevenson had admired for years
    and longed to meet was General Sherman. The war was long past,
    and he was then an old gentleman living very quietly. One day
    St. Gaudens took Stevenson to call on him, and he was asked
    afterward if he was at all disappointed in his hero.</p>

    <p>"Disappointed," he exclaimed. "It was simply magnificent to
    stand in the presence of one who has done what he has, and then
    to find him so genial and human. It was the next thing to
    seeing Wellington, and I dare say the Iron Duke would not have
    been half so human."</p>

    <p>The anticipation of a train trip across the continent was so
    distasteful that a proposed visit to Colorado was given up, and
    they decided to try the climate of the Adirondacks for the
    winter instead.</p>

    <p>They chose Saranac, not far from the Canadian border, and
    rented a cottage there.</p>

    <p>The climate was as unpleasant as possible. It rained,
    snowed, sleeted, and froze continually. The cold at times was
    arctic, the thermometer dropping thirty degrees below zero in
    January. "Venison was crunching with ice after being an hour in
    the oven, and a large lump of ice was still unmelted in a pot
    where water was steaming all around it."</p>

    <p>Their cottage was dubbed "Hunter's Home." It was far from
    the railroad, few luxuries were to be had, and they lived a
    simple life in earnest.</p>

    <p>Of course, they had a dog; no "hunter's home" would be
    complete without one, but Louis scouted the idea of adding
    things as unfitting as plush table-covers and upholstered
    footstools. The table went bare, and he fashioned a footstool
    for his mother out of a log, in true backwoods fashion.</p>

    <p>His wife and mother found the cold hard to bear, but he
    stood it remarkably well and benefited by it. Saranac reminded
    him of Scotland, he said, without the smell of peats and the
    heather.</p>

    <p>Dressed in a buffalo coat, astrakhan cap, and Indian boots,
    he and Lloyd walked, skated, or went sleighing every day.</p>

    <p>His pen was kept busy also. A new novel, "The Master of
    Ballantrae," was started, and he contributed a series of
    articles to <i>Scribner's Magazine</i>. For these he was paid a
    regular sum offered by the publishers and agreed upon in
    advance&mdash;a new experience. It made him feel "awfu' grand,"
    he told a Scotch friend.</p>

    <p>A venture he had been longing to make since a boy was a
    cruise among the islands of the South Seas. While enduring the
    bitter cold of Saranac such hazy ideas as he had had about such
    a trip began to form themselves into a definite scheme. He was
    anxious for a long voyage; perhaps the warm sea air might cure
    him after all else had failed.</p>

    <p>So night after night he and Lloyd eagerly pored over books
    and maps, and the family discussed plans for such an
    expedition.</p>

    <p>When spring came Mrs. Stevenson started for San Francisco to
    secure, if possible, a yacht in which they might undertake such
    a cruise. If all went well Louis and his mother and Lloyd would
    follow.</p>

    <p>While they waited for results they spent the time at
    Manasquan, on the New Jersey coast. There Stevenson and his son
    enjoyed the sailing, and their New York friends came often to
    see them.</p>

    <p>Mr. Low tells of the day at Manasquan when word was received
    from Mrs. Stevenson that she had found a schooner-yacht
    satisfactory for the voyage.</p>

    <p>An answer must be sent at once. Her husband telegraphed that
    they would come, but it was not without misgivings that he made
    this final decision. There was much at stake in an uncertain
    venture of the kind. It meant a sacrifice of comfort for his
    wife and mother, big expense, and perhaps no better health in
    the end.</p>

    <p>However, it seemed worth the risk, and having decided to go
    he began to look forward to the trip with boyish delight. "It
    will be horrid fun," he said, "to be an invalid gentleman on
    board a yacht, to walk around with a spy-glass under your arm,
    to make landings and trade beads and chromos for cocoanuts, and
    to have the natives swim out to meet you."</p>

    <p>He and Lloyd spent hours laying their course and making out
    lists of stores with which to furnish the schooner, regardless
    of the doubt expressed by their friends as to the capacity of
    the boat. "They calmly proceeded with their interminable lists
    and scorned the criticism of a mere land-lubber. All
    conversation that was not of a nautical character failed to
    hold their interest."</p>

    <p>Cheered with strong hopes for Louis's future, the family
    departed for San Francisco on the 28th of May, 1888. Their one
    regret was the good friends they were leaving behind. This
    particularly affected Louis, but he tried to hide his feelings
    by making all sorts of lively and impossible proposals for
    their joining him later on.</p>

    <p>His parting words to Mr. Low were: "There's England over
    there&mdash;and I've left it&mdash;perhaps I may never go
    back&mdash;and there on the other side of this big continent
    there's another sea rolling in. I loved the Pacific in the days
    when I was at Monterey, and perhaps now it will love me a
    little. I am going to meet it; ever since I was a boy the South
    Seas have laid a spell upon me."</p>

    <h3>IN THE SOUTH SEAS</h3>

    <p class="poem">"Since long ago, a child at home,
    <br>
     I read and longed to rise and roam,
    <br>
     Where'er I went, what'er I willed,
    <br>
     One promised land my fancy filled.
    <br>
     Hence the long road my home I made;
    <br>
     Tossed much in ships; have often laid
    <br>
     Below the uncurtained sky my head,
    <br>
     Rain-deluged and wind buffeted;
    <br>
     And many a thousand miles I crossed,
    <br>
     And corners turned&mdash;love's labor lost,
    <br>
     Till, Lady, to your isle of sun
    <br>
     I came, not hoping, and like one
    <br>
     Snatched out of blindness, rubbed my eyes,
    <br>
     And hailed my promised land with cries."</p>
    <br>


    <p>Once, while Louis was a discontented student at the
    University of Edinburgh, the premier of New Zealand, Mr. Seed,
    spent an evening with his father and talked about the South Sea
    Islands until the boy said he was "sick with desire to go
    there."</p>

    <p>From that time on a visit to that out-of-the-way corner of
    the earth was a cherished dream, and he read everything he
    could lay hands on that told about it.</p>

    <p>While in California, the first time, Mr. Virgil Williams, an
    artist, aroused his interest still more by the accounts of his
    own trip in the South Seas.</p>

    <p>Now his opportunity to see them had actually come. He
    already knew much of the kind of places and people they were
    going among.</p>

    <p>Three thousand miles across the open sea lay the Marquesas
    Islands, the first group they hoped to visit, and it was for
    that port their schooner, the <i>Casco</i>, turned her head
    when she was towed out of the Golden Gate at dawn on the 28th
    of June.</p>

    <p>Besides the family and a servant, Valentine Roch, who had
    been with them since Bournemouth days, the party consisted of
    the skipper, Captain Otis, who was well acquainted with the
    Pacific, a crew of four deck-hands, and a Japanese cook.</p>

    <p>The <i>Casco</i> was a fore-and-aft schooner, ninety-five
    feet in length, of seventy tons' burden. "She had most graceful
    lines and with her lofty masts, white sails and decks, and
    glittering brass work, was a lovely craft to the eye as she sat
    upon the water."</p>

    <p>"I must try to describe the vessel that is to be our home
    for so long," Mrs. Stevenson, senior, wrote to her sister at
    Colinton. "From the deck you step down into the cockpit, which
    is our open air drawing room. It has seats all around, nicely
    cushioned, and we sit or lie there most of the day. The compass
    is there, and the wheel, so the man at the wheel always keeps
    us company.... At the bottom of the stairs on the right hand
    side is the captain's room. Straight ahead is the main&mdash;or
    after&mdash;cabin, a nice bright place with a skylight and four
    portholes. There are four sofas that can be turned into beds if
    need be, and there are lockers under them in which our clothes
    are stored away. Above and behind each sofa is a berth
    concealed by white lace curtains on brass rods, and in these
    berths we three women are laid away as on shelves each night to
    sleep.</p>

    <p>"Opposite the entrance is a mirror let into the wall, with
    two small shelves under it. On each side of this is a door. The
    one to the right leads ... to Lloyd's cabin, and beyond that
    again is the forward cabin, or dining room. The door to the
    left opens into ... Louis' sleeping-room. It is very roomy with
    both a bed and a sofa in it, so that he will be very
    comfortable....</p>

    <p>"The dining room has a long table and chairs. Between the
    doors a very ugly picture of fruit and cake. Louis would fain
    cover it up if we could spare a flag with which to do it. The
    doors at the further end lead to the pantry and galley and
    beyond these are the men's quarters."</p>

    <p>No expense had been spared in building the <i>Casco</i> to
    make her comfortable. She was intended, however, for cruising
    in the California waters and was hardly suited to the rough
    handling she received during the squally weather of the next
    few months. Fortunately she stood the test well and her
    passengers suffered few discomforts.</p>

    <p>Once under way and settled for living, the trip proved quite
    uneventful. The long days were spent on deck reading or
    working, and Stevenson began to gather material for a book on
    the South Seas. The ship's life suited him admirably; every
    strange fish and new star interested him, and he grew stronger
    hourly in the warm air.</p>

    <p>"Since the fifth day," he wrote, "we were left behind by a
    full-rigged English ship ... bound round the Horn, we have not
    spied a sail, nor a land bird, nor a shred of sea-weed. In
    impudent isolation, the toy schooner has plowed her path of
    snow across the empty deep, far from all track of commerce, far
    from any hand of help; now to the sound of slatting sails and
    stamping sheet blocks, staggering in the turmoil of that
    business falsely called a calm, now, in the assault of squalls
    burying her lee-rail in the sea.... Flying fish, a skimming
    silver rain on the blue sea; a turtle fast asleep in the early
    morning sunshine; the Southern Cross hung thwart the
    forerigging like the frame of a wrecked kite&mdash;the pole
    star and the familiar plough dropping ever lower in the wake;
    these build up thus far the history of our voyage. It is
    singular to come so far and see so infinitely little."</p>

    <p>The squalls that came very quickly, frequently broke the
    monotony of the trip. One moment the <i>Casco</i> would be
    sailing along easily and the "next moment, the inhabitants of
    the cabin were piled one upon another, the sea was pouring into
    the cockpit and spouting in fountains through forgotten
    deadlights, and the steersman stood spinning the wheel for his
    life in a halo of tropical rain."</p>

    <p>After twenty-two days at sea they sighted their first
    island, Nukahiva, one of the Marquesan group, and were all on
    deck before dawn anxiously watching for it. They not only
    looked forward eagerly to the sight of land again after so many
    days on the open ocean, but it was indeed an adventure to come
    to a country totally strange to all of them, where few white
    people had been before.</p>

    <p>"Not one soul aboard the Casco had set foot upon the
    Islands," says Stevenson, "or knew except by accident one word
    of any of the island tongues; and it was with something perhaps
    of the same anxious pleasure as thrilled the bosom of the
    discoverers that we drew near these problematic shores.</p>

    <p>"Before yet the anchor plunged a canoe was already paddling
    from the hamlet. It contained two men: one white, one brown and
    tattooed across the face with bands of blue, both immaculate
    with white European clothes.... Canoe followed canoe till the
    ship swarmed with stalwart, six foot men in every stage of
    undress ... the more considerable tattooed from head to foot in
    awful patterns ... all talking and we could not understand one
    word; all trying to trade with us who had no thought of
    trading, or offering us island curios at prices palpably
    absurd."</p>

    <p>All this charmed and delighted Stevenson, who had dreamed
    many times of witnessing just such a scene. He wrote to Cummie
    that he was living all over again many of the stories she had
    read to him and found them coming true about himself.</p>

    <p>For six weeks they cruised about among these islands,
    frequently dropping anchor and going ashore for several days.
    When the natives were convinced that they had neither come to
    trade or to make trouble, but were simply interested in them
    and their country, they made the visitors most welcome and
    showered presents of fruit, mats, baskets, and fans upon
    them.</p>

    <p>All were eager to visit the schooner, which they called
    <i>Pahi Mani</i>, meaning the shining or the silver ship. The
    chiefs tried to measure its dimensions with their arms. The
    liveliest curiosity was shown about everything; the red velvet
    cushions, the looking-glasses, and the typewriter pleased
    particularly. A photograph of Queen Victoria hung in the
    fore-cabin and was always described to the island callers as
    <i>Vahine Haka-iki Beritano</i>, which meant literally,
    woman-great-chief Britain. It was a surprise to find how much
    many of them already knew about her.</p>

    <p>Some afternoons the <i>Casco</i> swarmed with these strange
    visitors who were always delighted at the refreshments of
    ship's biscuits and pineapple syrup and water offered them. A
    certain chief was particularly taken with a pair of gloves
    belonging to Mrs. Stevenson, senior. He smelled of them, called
    them British tattooing, and insisted on her putting them on and
    off a great many times.</p>

    <p>The entire family fell quickly into the island mode of
    living; dressed as the white inhabitants did; ate all the
    strange kinds of native food; and when ashore lived in the
    native houses, which resembled bird-cages on stilts. The
    climate suited them to perfection, and Stevenson particularly
    benefited by it, bathing daily in the warm surf and taking long
    walks along the beach in search of strange shells.</p>

    <p>"Here we are," his mother wrote to Cummie, "in a little bay
    surrounded by green mountains, on which sheep are grazing, and
    there are birds very like our own 'blackies' singing in the
    trees. If it were not for the groves of cocoanut palms, we
    might almost fancy ourselves in our own dear land. But the
    climate here is simply perfect. Of course it is hot, but there
    are always fresh breezes.... We have our principal meal at
    twelve o'clock, and spend the after part of the day on shore
    ... bathing, gathering shells, knitting, or reading. Our
    Japanese cook and steward just sets out the table with cold
    meats, fruit, and cake so that we can take our other meal at
    any time in the evening that suits us.</p>

    <p>"Fanny and I are dressed like natives, in two garments. As
    we have to wade to and from the boat in landing and coming
    back, we discard stockings, and on the sands we usually go
    barefoot entirely. Louis wears only a shirt and trousers with
    the legs and arms rolled up as far as they will go, and he is
    always barefooted. You will therefore not be surprised to hear
    that we are all as red as lobsters. It is a strange
    irresponsible half savage life, and I sometimes wonder if we
    shall ever be able to return to civilized habits
    again.</p><a name="image010"

    <p>"The natives are very simple and kindly people. The Roman
    Catholic priests have persuaded them to give up their constant
    wars and the practice of cannibalism, though only within recent
    years....</p>

    <p>"Louis has learned a good many words of the language, and
    with the help of signs can contrive to carry on a conversation,
    but I have stuck fast with two words: '<i>ka-oha</i>' which
    means 'How do you do?' 'thank you,' and 'good bye,' and I am
    not quite sure how much else, and '<i>Mitai</i>,' meaning good,
    nice, pretty, kind. I don't expect to get beyond these, but it
    is wonderful how much one can express with them....</p>

    <p>"The natives have got names for us all. Louis was at first
    'the old man,' much to his distress; but now they call him
    '<i>Ona</i>' meaning owner of the yacht, a name he greatly
    prefers to the first. Fanny is <i>Vahine</i>, or wife; I am the
    <i>old woman</i>, and Lloyd rejoices in the name of <i>Maté
    Karahi</i>, the young man with glass eyes (spectacles). Perhaps
    it is a compliment here to be called old, as it is in China, at
    any rate, one native told Louis that he himself was old, but
    his mother was not!...</p>

    <p>"A native dance was got up for our benefit. None of the
    dancing-women appeared, but five men dressed in shirt and
    trousers, danced together with spirit and grace. The music was
    provided by a drum, made out of an old tin box. Many of the
    steps reminded me of a Highland reel, but were curiously mixed
    up with calisthenic, and even gymnastic exercises; the hands in
    particular were used very gracefully, and they often took off
    their hats and waved them to and fro. But they also climbed on
    each other's shoulders, and did other strange things. After
    dancing for some time, they sang songs to us in a curious, low,
    weird kind of crooning. Altogether it was a strange sort of
    afternoon party!"</p>

    <p>The Marquesas Islands belong to the French, and the
    commandant in charge was most cordial to Stevenson, inviting
    him to his house frequently during his stay in the islands.
    When at the expiration of six weeks it was time for the
    <i>Casco</i> to weigh anchor and the party sailed on to explore
    still farther, they left behind them many friends who regretted
    their departure. Here as elsewhere in the South Seas, Stevenson
    showed his sympathy and kindliness toward the island people
    regardless of who they were or their rank. White or half-caste
    priest, missionary, or trader, all were treated the same. No
    bribe, he said, would induce him to call the natives
    savages.</p>

    <p>Mr. Johnstone, an English resident in the South Seas at the
    time of Stevenson's visit, says: "His inborn courtesy more than
    any of his other good traits, endeared him to his fellows in
    the Pacific ... in the hearts of our Island people he built a
    monument more lasting than stone or brass."</p>

    <p>The recollection of the history of his own wild Scottish
    Islands, the people and conditions his grandfather found among
    them, helped him to understand these people and account for
    many of their actions. Though at opposite ends of the earth,
    many of their customs and legends corresponded. The dwellers in
    the Hebrides in the old days likewise lived in clans with their
    chief and struggled to retain their independence against an
    invading power.</p>

    <p>Tahiti, one of the group of Society Islands, was their next
    stopping place. Before starting a new mate was shipped, who was
    more familiar with the course, which lay through the Dangerous
    Archipelago&mdash;a group of low, badly lighted islands.</p>

    <p>The Society Islands are most beautiful, Tahiti probably the
    gem of them all, but on arriving Stevenson was in no condition
    to appreciate their loveliness. A cold contracted on the trip
    made him quite ill. The trip had proved very dangerous even
    with the aid of a pilot, and twice they gave themselves up for
    lost when they were becalmed and drifted in toward the shore.
    "The reefs were close in," wrote Stevenson, "with my eye! What
    a surf! The pilot thought we were gone and the captain had a
    boat cleared, when a lucky squall came to our rescue."</p>

    <p>After landing his condition became so much worse his wife
    grew desperate and determined to find a comfortable spot for
    him. After much trouble a Chinaman with a team was secured, who
    agreed to drive the entire family to Tautira, the largest
    village, sixteen miles away over a road crossed by no less than
    twenty-one streams. On this uncertain venture they started,
    with the head of the family in a state of collapse, knowing
    nothing of the village they were going to or the living it
    would afford them.</p>

    <p>None of them ever regretted the perseverance which led them
    on, however, for in all their wanderings in the South Seas
    before or after no place ever charmed them more, or were they
    received with greater hospitality than in Tautira.</p>

    <p>The day after their arrival, Moe, an island princess and an
    ex-queen, visited them. When she found Stevenson ill she
    insisted he and his family be moved to her own house where they
    could have more comforts. The house at the time was occupied by
    Ori, a subchief, a subject and relative of the princess. But he
    and his family gladly turned out to make room for the visitors
    and lived in a tiny house near by.</p>

    <p>"Ori is the very finest specimen of native we have seen
    yet," wrote Mrs. Stevenson. "He is several inches over six
    feet, of perfect though almost gigantic proportions."</p>

    <p>As soon as her husband was strong enough to be about again
    he and Ori became great friends. Finally, according to an
    island custom, Stevenson was adopted into Ori's clan and became
    his brother. This likewise meant exchanging names and Ori
    became Rui, the nearest possible approach to Louis since there
    is no L or S in the Tahitian language. Louis in turn became
    Teriitera (pronounced Ter<i>ee</i>terah), which was Ori's
    Christian name, Ori standing merely for his clan title.</p>

    <p>To show their gratitude for the hospitality shown them by
    Ori and the people of the village, Stevenson decided to give a
    public feast.</p>

    <p>The feast day was set for Wednesday, and the previous Sunday
    a chief issued the invitations from the Farehau, a house
    resembling an enormous bird-cage in the centre of the village,
    from which all the news was read aloud to the people once a
    week.</p>

    <p>A feast of such size necessitated much preparation.</p>

    <p>"The chief, who was our guide in the matter," wrote Mrs.
    Stevenson, "found four large fat hogs, which Louis bought, and
    four cases of ship's biscuit were sent over from the Casco,
    which is lying at Papeete for repairs.... Our hogs were killed
    in the morning, washed in the sea, and roasted whole in a pit
    with hot stones. When done they were laid on their stomachs in
    neat open coffins of green basket work, each hog with his case
    of biscuits beside him. Early in the morning the entire
    population began bathing, a bath being the preliminary to
    everything. At about three o'clock&mdash;four was the hour
    set&mdash;there was a general movement toward our premises, so
    that I had to hurry Louis into his clothes, all white even to
    his shoes. Lloyd was also in white, but barefoot.... The chief,
    who speaks French very well, stood beside Louis to interpret
    for him. By the time we had taken our respective places on the
    veranda in front of our door, an immense crowd had assembled.
    They came in five detachments.... Each set of people came
    bending under the weight of bamboo poles laden with fruits,
    figs, fowls, etc. All were dressed in their gayest and many had
    wreaths of leaves or flowers on their heads. The prettiest
    sight of all was the children, who came marching two and two
    abreast, the bamboo poles lying lengthwise across their
    shoulders.</p>

    <p>"When all the offerings had been piled in five great heaps
    upon the ground, Louis made his oration to the accompaniment of
    the squealing of pigs, the cackling of hens, and the roar of
    the surf.... A speech was made in return on behalf of the
    village.... Each speaker finished by coming forward with one of
    the smaller things in his hand, which he offered personally to
    Louis, and then shook hands with us all and retired. Among
    these smaller presents were many fish-hooks for large fishing,
    laboriously carved from mother-of-pearl shell. One man came
    with one egg in each hand saying 'carry these to Scotland with
    you, let them hatch into cocks, and their song shall remind you
    of Tautira.' The schoolmaster, with a leaf-basket of rose
    apples, made his speech in French."</p>

    <p>While overhauling the <i>Casco</i> two or three days before
    they planned to leave Tautira, Captain Otis was shocked to find
    the whole upper half of the main masthead completely eaten out
    by dry-rot. This necessitated taking the schooner around to
    Papeete, on the other side of the island, for repairs. Under
    ordinary circumstances the setting of a new masthead need to
    have delayed them but a few days; in the South Seas, however,
    it was a different matter. Only after searching for days in
    Papeete was he able to find a man who knew anything of
    ship-carpentering, and when found he worked according to his
    own sweet will. So it was five weeks before the <i>Casco</i>
    was ready to return for her passengers, who in the meantime
    were in a state of anxiety as to her whereabouts.</p>

    <p>During their enforced stay Ori treated the entire family
    like a brother indeed, doing everything in his power to make
    their visit pleasant.</p>

    <p>At last, on Christmas Day, they were ready to depart. The
    entire population of Tautira came to the beach to bid them
    farewell, and as the <i>Casco</i> swung out of the harbor one
    of the French officials fired a salute of twenty-one guns with
    his army rifle and the schooner returned it with a
    heavy-tongued Winchester.</p>

    <p>Tautira had grown to seem like a real home to all of them.
    To leave it with very little hope of ever returning to see such
    good friends as Princess Moe and Ori was a real grief, while
    they in their turn were quite heart-broken. Stevenson's
    friendship had brought something into their lives they had
    never had before.</p>

    <p>Honolulu was the goal of the <i>Casco</i> now, and all
    eagerly looked forward to the letters waiting for them
    there&mdash;the first word from home since leaving San
    Francisco.</p>

    <p>Bad weather attended the <i>Casco</i> all the way. They were
    delayed by a succession of hurricanes and calms until the
    supply of food ran very low and they were reduced to a diet of
    "salt-horse" and ship-biscuit.</p>

    <p>The last forty-eight hours of their run was made in the very
    teeth of a furious gale when the captain took big risks by
    carrying full sail, with the hope of making port before their
    supply of food and water was entirely exhausted. In spite of
    the danger, Stevenson enjoyed this daring run hugely. Later,
    when he and Lloyd wrote "The Wrecker" together, this very
    episode figured in the story, Captain Otis under the name of
    Captain Nares performing a similar sail-carrying feat on the
    schooner <i>Norah Creina</i>.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Strong, Stevenson's stepdaughter, and her family were
    waiting in Honolulu and gave them a warm welcome. The
    travellers soon found themselves the centre of interest among
    Mrs. Strong's large circle of friends and it was with
    difficulty Stevenson found time to finish the last chapters of
    "The Master of Ballantrae," which he had been working on since
    leaving Saranac.</p>

    <p>Honolulu, with its street-cars, shops, electric lights, and
    mixture of native and foreign population, seemed strangely
    crowded and modern after the scenes they had recently left; too
    modern by far to suit Stevenson, who preferred the
    unconventional wild life of the islands they had come from.</p>

    <p>At the Royal Palace in Honolulu, Kalakaua, the last of the
    Hawaiian kings, still held court. He enjoyed R.L.S. and invited
    him often to the palace and told him the history and legends of
    many of the islands of the South Seas. It was from Kalakaua he
    first learned to know the troubled history of the Samoan
    Islands and of Apia, which was to be his future home.</p>

    <p>The Island of Molokai, the leper colony, lay not far off.
    While in Honolulu he spent several days there, in the place
    where Father Damien had lately done his splendid work.</p>

    <p>According to their original scheme they were to return home
    from Honolulu, but having come so far they were eager to see
    more. They had tasted the dangers and fascination of the life
    among the wild islands, each so different, and it had only
    whetted their appetites for what lay still beyond. The chances
    of coming so far again were slight; it seemed too good an
    opportunity to miss. So Stevenson wrote to the friends at home,
    whom he longed daily to see: "Yes&mdash;I own up&mdash;I am
    untrue to friendship and (what is less, but still considerable)
    to civilization. I am not coming home for another year.... But
    look here and judge me tenderly. I have had more fun and
    pleasure of my life these past months than ever before, and
    more health than any time in ten long years.... And this
    precious deep is filled with islands which we may still visit,
    and though the sea is a dreadful place, I like to be there, and
    like squalls (when they are over) and to draw near to a new
    island I can not say how much I like....</p>

    <p>"Remember me as I was at home, and think of me sea-bathing
    and walking about, as jolly as a sand boy; you will own the
    temptation is strong; and as the scheme, bar fatal accidents,
    is bound to pay into the bargain, sooner or later, it seems it
    would be madness to come home now, with an imperfect book ...
    and perhaps fall sick again by autumn.</p>

    <p>"It is a singular thing that as I was packing up old papers
    ere I left Skerryvore, I came on the prophecies of a drunken
    Highland sibyl, when I was sixteen. She said I was to be very
    happy,&mdash;to visit America and <i>to be much upon the
    sea</i>.... I can not say why I like the sea ... my poor
    grandfather it is from him I inherit the taste I fancy, and he
    was around many islands in his day; but I, please God, shall
    beat him at that before the recall is sounded."</p>

    <p>So the <i>Casco</i> was shipped back to San Francisco, Mrs.
    Stevenson, senior, returned to Scotland for a visit, and the
    trading schooner <i>Equator</i> was chartered for a trip among
    the Marshall, Gilbert, and Samoan Islands.</p>

    <p>Just before leaving, the following letter came from Ori,
    which Stevenson says he would rather have received than written
    "Red Gauntlet" or the "Sixth Æneid."</p>

    <p>"I make you to know my great affection. At the hour when you
    left us, I was filled with tears; my wife Rui Telime, also, and
    all my household. When you embarked I felt great sorrow. It is
    for this that I went upon the road, and you looked from that
    ship, and I looked at you on the ship with great grief until
    you had raised the anchor and hoisted the sail. When the ship
    started I ran along the beach to see you still; and when you
    were in the open sea I cried out to you 'Farewell Louis,' and
    when I was coming back to my house I seemed to hear your voice
    crying, 'Rui, farewell.' Afterwards I watched the ship as long
    as I could until the night fell; and when it was dark I said to
    myself: 'If I had wings I should fly to the ship to meet
    you,'... I wept then ... telling myself continually, 'Teriitera
    returns to his own country and leaves his dear Rui in
    grief.'... I will not forget you in my memory. Here is the
    thought: I desire to meet you again. It is my Teriitera makes
    the only riches I desire in this world. It is your eyes that I
    desire to see again. It must be that your body and my body
    shall eat together at one table, there is what would make my
    heart content. But now we are separated. May God be with you
    all. May His word and His mercy go with you, so that you may be
    well and we also, according to the words of Paul.</p>

    <p>"O<font size="-1">RI A ORI</font>, that is to say,
    R<font size="-1">UI</font>."</p>

    <p>"All told," said Stevenson, "if my books have enabled or
    helped me to make this voyage, to know Rui, and to have
    received such a letter, they have ... not been writ in
    vain."</p>

    <br>


    <p>On the 7th of December, when the family landed at Upolu, the
    chief of the Samoas or Samoan Islands, they little dreamed it
    was to be their home for the next four years and the last the
    master of the house was ever to know.</p>

    <p>It had been frequently borne upon Stevenson, however, while
    cruising among the Marshall and Gilbert Islands during the past
    months, that a home in either England or Scotland again was a
    vain dream for him.</p>

    <p>"I do not ask for health," he said, "but I will go anywhere
    and live in any place where I can enjoy the existence of a
    human being." He seldom complained and it is rare to find even
    the brave sort of cry he made against fate to a friend at this
    time.</p>

    <p>"For fourteen years I have not had a day's real health. I
    have wakened sick and gone to bed weary, and I have done my
    work unflinchingly. I have written in bed, and written out of
    it, written in hemorrhages, written in sickness, written torn
    by coughing, written when my head swam for weakness, and for so
    long, it seems to me I have won my wager and recovered my
    glove. I am better now, have been, rightly speaking, since I
    first came to the Pacific; and still few are the days when I am
    not in some physical distress. And the battle goes on&mdash;ill
    or well, is a trifle; so as it goes. I was made for a contest,
    and the Powers have so willed that my battlefield shall be this
    dingy inglorious one of the bed and the physics bottle."</p>

    <p>Here in the tropics he might hope to live and work years
    longer&mdash;a return to a cold climate, he now knew, would be
    fatal.</p>

    <p>Why not turn traders? Often on starry nights, drifting among
    the low islands, he and Lloyd and the captain of the
    <i>Equator</i> had lain out on deck and planned what a lark it
    would be to buy a schooner, cruise among the islands, and trade
    with the natives. They would write stories, too, about these
    strange island dwellers with their many weird superstitions and
    of the white men who drifted from all corners of the globe to
    make their home there.</p>

    <p>Already Captain Reid had told them many such tales which
    Stevenson wove into stories. The "Beach of Falesá" and the
    "Isle of Voices" are probably the two most famous, while "the
    strange story of the loss of the brigantine Wandering Minstrel
    and what men and ships do in that wild and beautiful world
    beyond the American continent" formed a plot for the story
    called "The Wrecker," which he and Lloyd Osbourne wrote
    together later on.</p>

    <p>Samoa was a place he was eager to visit. King Kalakaua at
    Honolulu had already told him much of its troubled history. The
    group of thirteen islands lay about four thousand two hundred
    miles southwest of San Francisco. At that time they were under
    the control of England, Germany, and the United States
    according to a treaty entered into in 1889. These countries
    appointed a chief justice, a president of the municipal
    council, three consuls, and three land commissioners. A native
    king was likewise recognized on each island.</p>

    <p>This triple control proved most unsatisfactory and for years
    past there had been constant friction among the officials and
    warlike outbreaks among the natives.</p>

    <p>These complications interested Stevenson. His first idea had
    been to stop there but a short time. He now found he wanted to
    remain in Samoa long enough to write its history.</p>

    <p>The Samoans are true Polynesians; a strong and handsome race
    whose reputation is high among all the people of the Pacific.
    The large majority have become Christians, but in spite of the
    influence of the missionaries and the foreign powers who
    control them, they retain many of their old customs and habits.
    They are naturally peace-loving in spite of their many wars.
    Fighting does not appeal to them for its own sake, and they
    enjoy a good family life, treating their women with great
    respect and lavishing affection upon their children.</p>

    <p>Stevenson wanted those at home to know these people better;
    his sympathy, which was ever with the weaker side, was
    instantly aroused in behalf of the natives, and he wanted to
    tell their side of the story.</p>

    <p>If they were to make a home anywhere in the South Seas there
    could be no better spot than Apia, the principal port and
    capital of these islands, as it had a good mail service, a most
    important feature to a writer. The monthly mail-steamers
    between San Francisco and Sydney, as well as other Australian
    mail-boats, stopped there.</p>

    <p>So he purchased four hundred acres on the hills three miles
    from Apia and preparations were immediately made for clearing
    the ground and building a house. Lloyd Osbourne left for
    England to bring back the household treasures from Skerryvore,
    to make a real home, and Stevenson and his wife lived gypsy
    fashion meanwhile in a four-room wooden house.</p>

    <p>The new home was named Vailima, which is Samoan for "Five
    Waters," there being five streams running through the
    property.</p>

    <p>The house was built of wood, painted dark green with a red
    roof. When finished its chief feature was the great hall
    within, sixty feet long, lined and ceiled with California
    redwood. Here among the home treasures&mdash;his own portrait,
    war dresses, corselets, fans, and mats presented to him by
    island kings&mdash;the marble bust of grandfather Stevenson
    smiled down with approval on many a motley gathering. Louis
    often wondered if they reminded the old gentleman of some of
    the strange people he had entertained years ago in Baxter
    Place.</p>

    <p>All about was dense, tropical undergrowth, only paths led to
    the house, and these must continually be cut out. All carrying
    was done by two big New Zealand pack-horses.</p>

    <p>A large garden was planted&mdash;Mrs. Stevenson's special
    hobby. Cocoanuts, oranges, guavas, and mangoes already grew on
    the estate. The ground was very fertile, and kava, the root of
    which is used for the Samoan national drink, pineapples, sweet
    potatoes, and eggplants were soon flourishing among other
    things. Limes were so plentiful that they formed the hedge
    about the place; citrons were so common that they rotted on the
    trees.</p><a name="image011"

    </div>

    <p>All this ground-breaking, house-building, and gardening were
    new to Stevenson, and he revelled in them to the neglect of his
    writing.</p>

    <p>"This is a hard and interesting and beautiful life we lead
    now," he wrote to Sidney Colvin. "Our place is in a deep cleft
    of Væa Mountain; some six hundred feet above the sea, embowered
    in forest, which is our strangling enemy, and which we combat
    with axes and dollars. I am crazy over outdoor work, and had at
    last to confine myself to the house, or literature must have
    gone by the board. <i>Nothing</i> is so interesting as weeding,
    clearing, and pathmaking; the oversight of laborers becomes a
    disease; it is quite an effort not to drop into the farmer; and
    it does make you feel so well. To come down covered with mud
    and drenched with sweat and rain after some hours in the bush,
    change, rub down, and take a chair in the verandah, is to taste
    a quiet conscience."</p>

    <p>Before his arrival in Apia, Stevenson's tale of "The Bottle
    Imp" had been translated into Samoan by the missionaries. When
    the natives discovered he was its author they immediately named
    him Tusitala, The Teller-of-Tales. He still owned the bottle,
    they said; it was that gave him the wealth to cruise about in a
    great boat and build a fine house. The family often wondered
    why native visitors were curious to see the inside of the great
    safe in the hall at Vailima until they found that it was the
    belief among the islanders that the safe was the bottle's
    hiding-place.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Stevenson, senior, returned with Lloyd from England,
    and later Mrs. Strong and her small son, Austin, came from
    Honolulu to make the family complete.</p>

    <p>The servants were all natives, "boys" as they called
    themselves. There were usually about half a dozen about the
    house, with a boy for the garden and to look after the cows and
    pigs, besides a band of outside laborers, varying from half a
    dozen to thirty, under Lloyd's direction.</p>

    <p>Sosimo was Stevenson's particular boy. He waited upon him
    hand and foot, looked after his clothes and his pony "Jack,"
    and was devoted in every way. His loyalty to his master lasted
    to the end of his own life.</p>

    <p>The servants were governed on something very like the clan
    system. A Vailima tartan was adopted for special occasions and
    Stevenson encouraged them to think of the household as a
    family, to take interest and pride in all its doings.</p>

    <p>On Sunday evenings the entire household was assembled. A
    chapter of the Samoan Bible was read and Samoan hymns sung.
    Then a prayer in English written by Stevenson was read,
    concluding with the Lord's Prayer in Samoan.</p>

    <p>If the master had cause to be displeased with any one of
    them, they were all summoned and reprimanded or fined.</p>

    <p>His stories delighted them. They were never tired of looking
    at the picture of Skerryvore Light and hearing about the rugged
    coasts of Tusitala's native island and of his father and
    grandfather who built lighthouses. The latter impressed them
    greatly, since building of any kind in Samoa is considered a
    fine art. The deeds of General Gordon, the Indian Mutiny, and
    Lucknow were likewise favorite tales when Tusitala showed them
    a treasure he prized highly: a message written by General
    Gordon from Khartoum. It was in Arabic on a small piece of
    cigarette-paper which might be easily swallowed should the
    messenger be captured. Stevenson always believed it to be the
    last message sent before the great general's death.</p>

    <p>They came to him for everything and he was ever ready with
    help and advice. They were quick to appreciate his justice and
    kindliness, and to a man were devoted to him. "Once Tusitala's
    friend, always Tusitala's friend," they said.</p>

    <p>With his customary energy he threw himself heart and soul
    for a time into the political troubles of the island, making
    himself the champion of the natives' cause. He wrote a series
    of letters to the papers at home stating his idea of the
    injustice shown the Samoans under their present government. It
    was a most delicate situation, and at times led to very
    strained relations between himself and the officials in
    Apia.</p>

    <p>Those at home wondered why Stevenson tampered with island
    politics at all. Why did he not simply leave them to the powers
    in charge?</p>

    <p>His answer was, he had made Samoa his home, the Samoans were
    his people, and he could not fail to resent any injustice shown
    them.</p>

    <p>Lloyd Osbourne says: "He was consulted on every imaginable
    subject.... Government chiefs and rebels consulted him with
    regard to policy; political letters were brought to him to read
    and criticise.... Parties would come to hear the latest news of
    the proposed disarming of the country, or to arrange a private
    audience with one of the officials; and poor war-worn
    chieftains, whose only anxiety was to join the winning side and
    who wished to consult with Tusitala as to which that might be.
    Mr. Stevenson would sigh sometimes as he saw these stately
    folks crossing the lawn in single file, their attendants
    following behind with presents and baskets, but he never failed
    to meet or hear them."</p>

    <p>He aided one party of chieftains in prison, and to show
    their gratitude on regaining their freedom they cleared and dug
    a splendid road leading to his house. All the labor and expense
    they bore themselves, which amounted to no small matter. Ala
    Loto Alofa, they called it, the Road of the Loving Hearts.</p>

    <p>Warlike outbreaks were not infrequent near Vailima. The
    woods were often full of scouting parties and the roll of drums
    could be heard. One day as Stevenson and Mrs. Strong were
    writing together they were interrupted by a war party crossing
    the lawn. Mrs. Strong asked: "Louis, have we a pistol or gun in
    the house that will shoot?" and he answered cheerfully without
    stopping his work: "No, but we have friends on both sides."</p>

    <p>With all their political differences he and the officials
    retained friendly feeling. He paid calls on them at Apia and
    attended various town gatherings, while they were often
    entertained at Vailima.</p>

    <p>Always hospitable, it was a delight to him now to keep open
    house. Not only the chief justice, the consuls, the doctor, the
    missionaries, and the traders were in the habit of dropping in
    to Vailima, but from every ship that docked at Apia came some
    visitor who was anxious to meet Stevenson and his family; from
    the war-ships came the officers and sailors.</p>

    <p>The bluejackets were always particularly welcome. Mrs.
    Strong tells of a party who came from H.M.S. <i>Wallaroo</i> on
    one Thanksgiving Day, when "the kitchen department was in great
    excitement over that foreign bird the turkey" and all was
    confusion. "But Louis kept his sailors on all the afternoon. He
    took them over the house and showed them ... the curiosities
    from the islands, the big picture of Skerryvore lighthouse,...
    the treasured bit of Gordon's handwriting from Khartoum, in
    Arabic letters on a cigarette paper,... and the library, where
    the Scotchmen gathered about an old edition of Burns, with a
    portrait. Louis gave a volume of Underwoods (Stevenson's poems)
    with an inscription to Grant, the one who hailed from
    Edinburgh, and the man carried it carefully wrapped in his
    handkerchief. They went away waving their hats and keeping
    step."</p>

    <p>A croquet-ground and tennis-court were laid out, and Vailima
    was the scene of balls, dinners, and parties of all kinds. No
    birthday or holiday, English, American, or Samoan, was allowed
    to pass unnoticed, and the natives were included in these
    festivities whenever possible.</p>

    <p>The first Christmas at Vailima they had a party for the
    children who had never before seen a Christmas tree.</p>

    <p>Tusitala's birthday was always a special event to his island
    friends. The feast was served in native style; all seated about
    on the floor. Rather large gatherings they must have been, to
    judge from Mrs. Strong's account. "We had sixteen pigs roasted
    whole underground, three enormous fish (small whales, Lloyd
    called them), four hundred pounds of beef, ditto of pork, 200
    heads of taro, great bunches of bananas, native delicacies done
    up in bundles of <i>ti</i> leaves, 800 pineapples, many
    weighing fifteen pounds, all from Lloyd's patch. Among the
    presents for Tusitala, besides flowers and wreaths, were fans,
    native baskets ... and cocoanut cups beautifully
    polished."</p><a name="image012"
          id="image012"></a>

             alt="A feast of chiefs"> <span class="caption">A feast
             of chiefs</span>
    </div>

    <p>On these occasions the hosts were often entertained with
    dances and songs. All the Samoans are great singers. They
    composed songs about everything and everybody, so that one
    could judge the standing a person held by the songs that were
    sung about him.</p>

    <p>Those sung at Vailima parties were usually written by one of
    the house "boys" and "they were danced and acted with great
    spirit.... Sometimes every member of the family would be
    represented ... but the central figure, the heart of the song
    was always Tusitala."</p>

    <p>It is a marvel with the many demands made upon him, his
    varied interests, and frequent visits to neighboring islands,
    Stevenson still found time to write stories, poems, prayers,
    notes of the South Sea Islands, Samoan history, and many, many
    letters. "It is a life that suits me but absorbs me like an
    ocean," he said. Through it all his health continued fairly
    good. He was able to take long tramps and rides that would have
    been physically impossible two years before.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Strong acted as his secretary and the majority of his
    writing now was done by dictation. "He generally makes notes
    early in the morning," she wrote, "which he elaborates as he
    reads them aloud ... he never falters for a word, but gives me
    the sentence with capital letters and all the stops as clearly
    and steadily as though he were reading from an unseen
    book."</p>

    <p>The two South Sea books occupied much of his time, but it
    was of his own land and people so far away that he had so
    little hope of ever seeing again, he loved best to write.</p>

    <p>"It is a singular thing," he wrote to James Barrie, "that I
    should live here in the South Seas, and yet my imagination so
    continually inhabit the cold old huddle of grey hills from
    which we came."</p>

    <p>He finished and sent away further adventures of David
    Balfour and Alan Breck under the title of "David Balfour." "St.
    Ives" followed with its scenes laid around Edinburgh Castle,
    Swanston Cottage, and the Pentland Hills. In his last book,
    "Weir of Hermiston," the one he left unfinished, broken off in
    the midst of a word, he roamed the streets of Auld Reekie again
    with a hero very like what he had once been himself, who was
    likewise an enthusiastic member of the "Spec."</p>

    <p>Something which pleased him greatly at this time was the
    news from his friend Charles Baxter in Edinburgh that a
    complete edition of his works was to be published in the best
    possible form with a limited number of copies, to be called the
    "Edinburgh Edition."</p>

    <p>"I suppose it was your idea to give it that name," Stevenson
    wrote, thanking him. "No other would have affected me in the
    same manner.... Could a more presumptuous idea have occurred to
    us in those days when we used to search our pockets for
    coppers, too often in vain, and combine forces to produce the
    threepence necessary for two glasses of beer, than that I
    should be strong and well at the age of forty three in the
    island of Upolu, and that you should be at home bringing out
    the 'Edinburgh Edition'?"</p>

    <p>In spite of the many interests in his present life, his love
    for the people and the country, the yearning for the friends
    far away grew daily.</p>

    <p>How he longed to have them see Vailima with all its
    beauties! To talk over old times again. Such visits were
    continually planned, but they were never realized.</p>

    <p>He seldom complained and those who were with him every day
    rarely found him low in spirits. It was into the letters to his
    old intimates that these longings crept when it swept over him
    that, though a voluntary exile in a pleasant place, he was an
    exile none the less, with the fate of him who wrote:</p>

    <p class="poem">"There's a track across the deep,
    <br>
     And a path across the sea,
    <br>
     But for me there's nae return
    <br>
     To my ain countree."</p>

    <p>"When the smell of the good wet earth" came to him it came
    "with a kind of Highland tone." A tropic shower found him in a
    "frame of mind and body that belonged to Scotland." And when he
    turned to write the chronicle of his grandfather's life and
    work, the beautiful words in which he described the old
    gentleman's farewell to "Sumbraugh and the wild crags of Skye"
    meant likewise his own farewell to those shores. No more was he
    to "see the topaz and ruby interchange on the summit of Bell
    Rock," no more to see "the castle on its hills," or the
    venerable city which he always thought of as his home.</p>

    <p>"Like Leyden," he wrote, "I have gone into a far land to
    die, not stayed like Burns to mingle in the end with Scottish
    soil."</p>

    <p>It was drawing near the close of their fourth year in Apia.
    On November 13 his birthday had been celebrated with the usual
    festivities, and on Thanksgiving Day he had given a dinner to
    his American friends&mdash;and then the end of all his
    wanderings and working came suddenly.</p>

    <p>"He wrote hard all that morning of the last day," says Lloyd
    Osbourne, "on his half-finished book Hermiston.... In the
    afternoon the mail fell to be answered; not business
    correspondence&mdash;but replies to the long, kindly letters of
    distant friends, received but two days since, and still bright
    in memory.</p>

    <p>"At sunset he came downstairs.... He was helping his wife on
    the verandah, and gaily talking, when suddenly he put both
    hands to his head, and cried out, 'What's that?' Then he asked
    quickly, 'Do I look strange?' Even as he did so he fell on his
    knees beside her. He was helped into the great hall, between
    his wife and body-servant, Sosimo, losing consciousness
    instantly, as he lay back in the arm-chair that had once been
    his grandfather's. Little time was lost in bringing the
    doctors, Anderson of the man-of-war, and his friend Dr. Funk.
    They looked at him and shook their heads ... he had passed the
    bounds of human skill....</p>

    <p>"The dozen and more Samoans that formed part of the clan of
    which he was chief, sat in a wide semicircle on the floor,
    their reverent, troubled, sorrow-stricken faces all fixed upon
    their dying master. Some knelt on one knee to be instantly
    ready for any command that might be laid upon them....</p>

    <p>"He died at ten minutes past eight on Monday evening the 3rd
    of December, in the forty-fifth year of his age.</p>

    <p>"The great Union Jack that flew over the house was hauled
    down and laid over the body, fit shroud for a loyal Scotsman.
    He lay in the hall which was ever his pride, where he had
    passed the gayest and most delightful hours of his life.... In
    it were the treasures of his far off Scottish home.... The
    Samoans passed in procession beside his bed, kneeling and
    kissing his hand, each in turn, before taking their places for
    the long night watch beside him. No entreaty could induce them
    to retire, to rest themselves for the painful arduous duties of
    the morrow. It would show little love for Tusitala, they said,
    if they did not spend their last night beside him. Mournful and
    silent, they sat in deep dejection, poor, simple, loyal folks,
    fulfilling the duty that they owed their chief.</p>

    <p>"A messenger was dispatched to a few chiefs connected with
    the family, to announce the tidings and bid them assemble their
    men on the morrow for the work there was to do....</p>

    <p>"The morning of the 4th of December broke cool and sunny....
    A meeting of chiefs was held to apportion the work and divide
    the men into parties. Forty were sent with knives and axes to
    cut a path up the steep face of the mountain, and the writer
    himself led another party to the summit&mdash;men chosen from
    the immediate family&mdash;to dig the grave on the spot where
    it was Robert Louis Stevenson's wish that he should lie....
    Nothing more picturesque can be imagined than the ledge that
    forms the summit to Væa, a place no wider than a room, and flat
    as a table. On either side the land descends precipitously; in
    front lies the vast ocean and surf-swept reefs; to the right
    and left green mountains rise....</p>

    <p>"All the morning Samoans were arriving with flowers, few of
    these were white, for they have not learned our foreign custom,
    and the room glowed with the many colors. There were no
    strangers on that day, no acquaintances; those only were called
    who would deeply feel the loss. At one o'clock a body of
    powerful Samoans bore away the coffin, hid beneath a tattered
    red ensign that had flown above his vessel in many a remote
    corner of the South Seas. A path so steep and rugged taxed
    their strength to the utmost, for not only was the journey
    difficult in itself, but extreme care was requisite to carry
    the coffin shoulder high....</p>

    <p>"No stranger hand touched him.... Those who loved him
    carried him to his last home; even the coffin was the work of
    an old friend. The grave was dug by his own men."</p>

    <p>Tusitala had left them, and his friends in the South Seas
    had lost a faithful friend and companion, a wise and just
    master.</p>

    <p>His family and friends the world over had lost not only
    these but far more. His life had been a chivalrous one with all
    the best that chivalry stands for, "loyalty, honesty,
    generosity, courage, courtesy, and self-devotion; to impute no
    unworthy motives and to bear no grudges; to bear misfortune
    with cheerfulness and without a murmur; to strike hard for the
    right and to take no mean advantage; to be gentle to women and
    kind to all that are weak; to be rigorous with oneself and very
    lenient to others&mdash;these ... were the traits that
    distinguished Stevenson."</p>

    <p>"They do not make life easy as he frequently found."</p>

    <p>His resting-place on the crest of Væa Mountain is covered by
    a tomb of gray stone. On one side is inscribed in English the
    verses he had written for his own requiem:</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
